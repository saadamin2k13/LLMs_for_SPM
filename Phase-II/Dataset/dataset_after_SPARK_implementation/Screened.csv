replay based continual learning for test case prioritization,"Fariha, A.; Azim, A.; Liscano, R.",10.1109/ICSTW60967.2024.00031,2024,in a large scale continuous integration  ci  environment  regression testing can encounter high time and resource demands in ad hoc execution  therefore  test case prioritization  tcp  is crucial for enhancing the regression testing efficiency of ci  tcp methods aim to optimize regression testing by ordering test cases to effectively cover new code changes and their potential side effects and to maximize early fault detection  traditional prioritization processes use diverse data sources  including code coverage analysis  test execution history  and domain specific features  heuristic based or code coverage driven prioritization techniques may not be sufficient for accurate results in a rapidly changing environment  for this reason  there has been a significant shift towards employing machine learning  ml  techniques in tcp in recent years to harness the vast and complex datasets generated by ci practices  ml based tcp approaches integrate multifaceted test case features from various sources to enhance the accuracy of test case prioritization  this trend reflects a broader movement towards data driven decisionmaking in software testing  offering the potential to significantly reduce the regression testing burden by tailoring test suites more effectively to the needs of each software build  thereby saving time and resources while maintaining or improving the software quality  recent studies have shown that the ml based methods used in tcp can be categorized into four groups  supervised learning  unsupervised learning  reinforcement learning  and natural language processing  codebases for software projects can be changed rapidly by introducing new feature distributions into the ci systems  we analyzed a java application s ci and version control system  vcs  history data received from the international business machines corporation  ibm   1   6   7  the frequent inclusion of new test suites introduced new patterns into the dataset properties  to keep up with these changes  ml models require frequent re training on old and new datasets to maintain high accuracy on new data  the volume of the dataset tends to increase with time as more data becomes available  frequent re training of ml models on the entire dataset is computationally costly and requires extensive storage  reinforcement learning focuses on finding the best solution through reward maximization  2  and restricts the learning goal  learning incrementally from new non stationary data without requiring an old dataset to solve this tcp problem  continual learning  cl  or life long learning  incremental learning adapts to changes without needing old training samples  while cl has recently been studied in several works for different domains  we could not find effective research on implementing cl in the tcp domain  given the dynamic environment of software testing  we apply cl in industrial test case prioritization is critical for maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness of software testing processes in dynamic environments  however  modifying ml models on new datasets may introduce other problems  such as catastrophic forgetting  this can occur when the model is trained on a new distribution  and the model weights change drastically  different strategies have been suggested to solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting in cl  this abstract discusses the integration of pre training and replay based continual learning methods to enhance test case prioritization  pre trainingbased continual learning leverages the strong representation of pre training models on a large dataset  this approach helps initialize the model with a broad understanding  which can be further incrementally trained to accommodate new tasks without significant performance loss on previous tasks  the dataset we obtained from ibm has a few years of test execution data for the ci and vcs  the model can be trained using a large volume of data for the pre training method  replay based continual learning  however  involves retaining a small buffer of old training samples  this strategy includes a small fraction of old samples with a new dataset while incrementally training the model  enabling it to maintain its performance on older tasks by reinforcing the previous learning  integrating pre training and replay based methods is most effective in the literature  3  pre training provides a solid foundation for generic knowledge  replay based methods complement this by continuously reinforcing past learning  ensuring that the adaptation to new tasks does not come at the expense of previously acquired knowledge  several design choices leverage the benefits of this combined method  the frequency of incremental training on new datasets is an important design decision  this frequency can be timedriven or property driven  experimental work will guide the decision on incremental training frequency  next  in replay based approaches  the memory buffer size  number of old samples  and criteria for old sample selection are some of the decision parameters  in addition  a small buffer memory requires effective management in terms of data retaining strategies  the empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of this integrated approach  hu et al   4  introduced prioritized experience replay in continual learning  emphasizing the selection of representative experiences to alleviate catastrophic forgetting  similarly  merlin et al   5  provided practical recommendations for replay based continual learning methods  highlighting the importance of memory size and data augmentation in enhancing the performance  we will conduct detailed investigations to determine the optimal values for these decision parameters  for time based frequency  we will experiment at different intervals  such as weekly  every ten or 15 days  monthly  three months  and six months of incremental training  property based choices can be new test suite additions  significant changes in test suites  and an increase or decrease in the test case failure rate  similarly  for the replay based method  samples can be selected from each incremental training dataset  the selection can be random or property based  for example  an even distribution of passed or failed samples could be selected to avoid overfitting  in conclusion  integrating pretraining and replay based continual learning methods presents a promising research direction for enhancing large scale test case prioritization in ci  future research should explore different strategies to maximize the benefits of continual learning in test case

background
artificial intelligence  ai  may support accurate  efficient radiology diagnostics  however  little is known about implementing ai in clinical settings  in 2023  nhs england launched a programme funding 12 networks of 66 nhs trusts to implement ai for chest diagnostics  including lung cancer 
methods
rapid evaluation  march september 2024  of procurement and early deployment of ai for chest diagnostics at network  n   10  and trust  n   6  levels  we interviewed network teams  trust staff  and ai suppliers  n   51  observed planning  governance  and training  n   57  and analysed relevant documents  n   166  the nasss framework guided thematic analysis 
findings
procurement and deployment of ai took longer than anticipated  procurement involved engaging selection panels  assessing tenders  and contracting ai suppliers  preparation for deployment involved ai integration  governance processes  staff engagement and training  planning patient engagement  and collating impact data  patient communication plans varied and were still developing  challenges included  engaging staff with high clinical workloads  staff s limited ai knowledge  time to participate  and concerns over appropriate tool usage  managing unsuccessful suppliers  responses  and varied local governance processes  it systems  and data availability and quality  enablers included  programme leadership s support  networks sharing expertise and capacity  committed clinical  technical  and procurement specialists and ai suppliers  clinical champions  and dedicated project management 
interpretation
implementing ai involved complex social and technical processes  requiring significant resources  future implementation may benefit from ensuring sufficient time and capacity  ongoing stakeholder engagement at multiple levels  and greater consideration of patients and equity  diversity  and inclusion  influential factors identified here mirror research on other healthcare innovations  suggesting ai may not address service challenges as straightforwardly as policymakers anticipate

using nonlinear quantile regression for the estimation of software cost,J. De AndrésM. LandajoP. Lorca,10.1007/978-3-319-92639-1_35,2018,estimation of effort costs is an important task for the management of software development projects  researchers have followed two approaches  namely  statistical machine learning and theory based  which explicitly rely on mean median regression lines in order to model the relationship between software size and effort  those approaches share a common drawback deriving from their inability to properly incorporate risk attitudes in the presence of heteroskedasticity  we propose a more flexible quantile regression approach that enables risk aversion to be incorporated in a systematic way  with the higher order conditional quantiles of the relationship between project size and effort being used to represent more risk adverse decision makers  a cubic quantile regression model allows consideration of economies diseconomies of scale  the method is illustrated with an empirical application to a database of real projects  results suggest that the shapes of higher order regression quantiles may sharply differ from that of the conditional median  revealing that the naive expedient of translating or multiplying some average norm  adding a safety margin to median estimates or including a multiplicative correction factor  is a potentially biased way to consider risk aversion  the proposed approach enables a more realistic analysis  adapted to the specificities of software development databases ,using nonlinear quantile regression for the estimation of software cost,andrsmdejlandajoplorca
