In the digital economy, the known principle of the impossibility to automate chaos is replaced by a need for situational control based on providing multi-level fully functional project management using artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI). At the same time, the system of distributed situational centers can become an effective tool for supporting strategic goal-setting. Much that has been done in this field and in the field of AI is of profound significance, but the classical approach to AI cannot embrace the different levels of the subjects’ emotions, consciousness, and the collective unconscious. The aspects of breakthrough and disruptive management urgently need to be developed. Attention must be focused on the issue of collective decision making under conditions of uncertainty causes and in unforeseen situations. Priority should be given to the socio-humanitarian and collective cognitive aspects of AI applications. Under these conditions, distributed situational centers system and some methods of AGI become the main cross-cutting digital technologies for ensuring corporate strategic goal-setting in the digital economy.",21st IFAC World Congress,2405-8963

However, a persistent challenge that these industries face is delivery delays, caused by a number of complex factors, including supply chain issues, project management difficulties, technical and work issues. To address this issue, several approaches and methodologies have been adopted. On the one hand, agile management tools such as Scrum, Prince2 Agile, Lean Project Management, Agile Project Management and DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method) have been implemented to increase the flexibility and adaptability of production processes. On the other hand, classic analytical solutions, such as the Gantt/Waterfall Method, PMBOK Guide, Spiral Model, Prince2 and the Critical Path Method (CPM) and/or the PERT method, have been applied to ensure a clearer and more structured view of projects. In addition to these traditional approaches, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in project management. A detailed analysis of articles reveals a marked preference for Machine Learning (ML), with particular emphasis on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These AI techniques have been successfully applied in a variety of projects, especially in civil construction, helping to predict and mitigate delays, improve operational efficiency and optimize resource allocation. Despite the progress made, research on the use of AI in project management still faces significant challenges, as reflected in the scarcity of available studies on the topic in project management in the metalworking industry.",57th CIRP Conference on Manufacturing Systems 2024 (CMS 2024),2212-8271

Central to this program is its strong focus on project management and engineering leadership, to drive ethical decision-making in their professional contexts. A total of 102 current and graduated students from the master's program were surveyed to explore their use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Grammarly, in both professional and academic contexts. The survey showed that 98 % of students actively use generative AI, demonstrating an awareness of its potential and usefulness. While anecdotal evidence suggests moral hazard including plagiarism, undisclosed AI use and reliance on AI without independent reasoning. 94 % Of students seek clear institutional policies at the university and program levels to guide the ethical use of AI in academia. Students with higher confidence in their academic writing tend to perceive the quality of AI-generated content to be slightly inferior to their own work, highlighting varying dependency levels across the cohort. Furthermore, many students believe that universities should adopt explicit guidelines to define when and how AI tools are appropriate for academic work. These findings suggest that the absence of clear policies exacerbates ethical conflicts, impacting both educators and students. The results of this research underscore the urgency of developing transparent guidelines to safeguard academic integrity while embracing the potential of generative AI. By framing the findings within the moral hazard theory, this study highlights the risks of over-reliance on AI tools and opens avenues for future research into their responsible integration in higher education.",,2666-7215

Issue tracking systems (ITS) store project task data that is valuable for analytics and simulation. Projects typically include two types of tasks: stateful and recurring. While stateful tasks can be automatically categorized with relative ease, categorizing recurring tasks remains challenging. Prior research indicates that a key difficulty may lie in the underrepresentation of certain task types, which leads to severely imbalanced training datasets and hampers the accuracy of machine-learning models for task categorization.
Aims:
The goal of this study is to evaluate whether leveraging large language models (LLM) for data augmentation can enhance the machine-learning-based categorization of recurring tasks in software projects.
Method:
We conduct our study on a dataset from six industrial projects comprising 9,589 tasks. To address class imbalance, we up-sample minority classes during training via data augmentation using LLMs and several prompting strategies, assessing their impact on prediction quality. For each project, we perform time-series 5-fold cross-validation and evaluate the classifiers using state-of-the-art metrics — Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and MCC — as well as practice-inspired metric called Monthly Classification Error (MCE) that assess the impact of task misclassification on project planning and resource allocation. Our machine-learning pipeline employs Transformer-based sentence embeddings and XGBoost classifiers.
Results:
The model automatically classifies software process tasks into 14 classes, achieving MCC values between 0.71 and 0.76. We observed higher prediction quality for the largest projects in the dataset and for those managed using “traditional” project management methodologies. Moreover, employing intra-project data augmentation strategies reduced the MCE error by up to 43%.
Conclusions:
Our findings indicate that large language models (LLMs) can be used to mitigate the impact of imbalanced task categories, thereby enhancing the performance of classification models even with limited training data.",,0164-1212

Current practices for forecasting the effectiveness of a construction project include an evaluation that is still laborious, long-drawn-out, and can prone to errors. Digitalization has a tremendous potential to enhance management practices in the field of construction. The building sector has been reluctant to admit new technology. This points out the importance of an automated method for tracking the progress of projects. The goal of this research is to implement a monitoring system for Construction Progress Tracking (CPT). Machine learning and image processing techniques are used to ensure CPT automatically. In particular, masonry activity in construction is focused, though it can be broadened to other construction work. The proposed deep learning model is trained using a set of data of 356 images taken from several worksites and websites. The proposed system is demonstrated with OpenCV Python language and an automated progress report is generated in Microsoft excel. The study developed a platform for automated building project progress monitoring. It has also built a systematic strategy for gathering the standardized dataset for benchmarking purposes. The following are some of the study's notable findings: A supervised CNN classifier was constructed for brickwork recognition using spatial and color information. The classifier worked well, with accuracy and recall values of 81% and 83%, respectively. A uniform collection of 356 photos was created. This resulted in the creation of a benchmarked dataset for a masonry wall. The achieved results reveal high precision and speed to effectively detect the construction project without the interference of human activities, thereby facilitating improved inspection and supervision.",International Conference on Advances in Construction Materials and Structures,2214-7853

Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).",,2096-7209

Earned value management (EVM) is the most common method to evaluate and further predict a project in terms of time and cost. Because of poor accuracy in forecasting different durations, the application of the EVM for schedule performance prediction has been limited. Therefore, in this paper, the Kalman filter was used to analyze the data and compare the results with those of a few hybrid machine learning (HML) techniques. The innovation of this study comes in the face of the prediction of the project time and cost by efficient machine learning algorithms based on some directly measurable variables. For this purpose, 398 data points from five different dam projects were used to predict two output variables by hybrid schemes of multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm combined with the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), herein referred to as MLP-GA and MLP-PSO, respectively. Four input variables, namely earned schedule (month), earned value ($), actual progress (%), and actual cost (%), were considered for time prediction, and the time (month) was considered as an input variable for cost prediction. The results showed that early warnings for the risk of delay in project schedule and cost were generated in months 1 and 8 by the MLP-PSO, months 1 and 11 by the MLP-GA, and rather months 7 and NV (no value) for the Kalman filter, indicating the fast operation coupled with high accuracy of the HML algorithms, as compared to the Kalman filter. In addition, the two HML algorithms were compared based on statistical error indices to determine the best one. After reviewing the results, the MLP-PSO was found to outperform the MLP-GA in terms of convergence rate and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous studies have used the proposed hybrid algorithms (MELM-PSO and MELM-GA) for forecasting, simultaneously, the time and cost as two critical parameters in the project management, indicating the novelty of our research.",,1226-7988

At this stage, people have increasing requirements for power service quality. However, electric power enterprises (EPEs) are unable to meet such demands because of several limitations, such as the surge of power grid operation risk, insufficient systematic service level and unreasonable enterprise architecture. DT is an effective way for EPEs to improve their management and service level. Power grid enterprises should follow the trend of digital development and actively carry out DT. In simulating the operation of the power system, the first step is to establish a grid connection between the simulated generator and the simulated power grid. This involves adjusting the generator excitation to regulate the generator voltage and adjusting the output of the prime mover to regulate the generator frequency. This study explored the management mode and implementation path of DT of EPEs, proposed the DT management mode of EPEs based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and conducted an experimental research. The research showed that the average of the four- month informatisation project management level index of the enterprise S simulation model was 3.02 % higher than that of the four-month informatisation project management level index of the enterprise T simulation model. The average value of the operation and maintenance (O&M) and service management index of the enterprise S simulation model was 3.14 % higher than that of the enterprise T simulation model. The improvement of the management level index and the average O&M of simulation models can enhance the operational efficiency of enterprises and provide them with clear development directions. The average value of production security management index, network security management index and data asset management index of the enterprise S simulation model was higher than those of the enterprise T simulation model. The DT management mode of power grid enterprises based on AI algorithms is an effective driving force for power supply enterprises to achieve modernisation and standardised development.",,2666-2027

Firstly, the core issues of project progress, resource allocation, and risk control in engineering management can be systematically identified. Then, this article designs an intelligent decision support system based on machine learning and deep learning, constructs a multidimensional prediction model, and achieves project key milestone prediction, resource scheduling optimization, and potential risk analysis. Finally, an intelligent management framework that adapts to projects of different scales is introduced. Through data collection, real-time analysis, and reinforcement learning dynamic decision support mechanisms, iterative optimization of resource allocation and risk control is achieved. At time points 3, 4, 6, and 9, the probability of actual risk events occurring increases, and the prediction accuracy of the Bayesian network model significantly improves. Its predictions at these time points almost completely match the actual situation (the predicted values are the same as the actual values). The combination of artificial intelligence algorithms and intelligent transformation paths provides new development opportunities for the field of engineering management. By gradually building an intelligent management system, not only can the management level of engineering projects be effectively improved, but also the optimal allocation of resources, precise control of risks, and efficient achievement of project goals can be achieved.",The 5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics for IoT Security and Privacy (SPIoT2024),1877-0509

The methodology used for this tertiary study is based on Kitchenham and Charter's guidelines [14], resulting in a selection of 30 reviews published between 2005 and 2019 which are reporting results of 2021 primary studies. These reviews cover the AI adoption across various business sectors (healthcare, information technology, energy, agriculture, apparel industry, engineering, smart cities, tourism and transport), management and business functions (HR, customer services, supply chain, health and safety, project management, decision-support, systems management and technology adoption). While the drivers for the AI adoption in these areas are mainly economic, the barriers are related to the technical aspects (e.g. availability of data, reusability of models) as well as the social considerations such as, increased dependence on non-humans, job security, lack of knowledge, safety, trust and lack of multiple stakeholders’perspectives. Very few reviews outside of the healthcare management domain consider human, organisational and wider societal factors of the AI adoption. In addition to increased focus on social implications of AI, the reviews are recommending more rigorous evaluation, increased use of hybrid solutions (AI and non-AI) and multidisciplinary approach to AI design and evaluation.

However, despite the high number of uncertainties and risks of these projects, there is a lack of dedicated risk management frameworks beyond the guidelines established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Project Management Institute (PMI). This study aims to propose an integrated framework for managing risks in Nuclear Decommissioning Projects. For the development of the framework artificial intelligence algorithms were employed, integrating models derived from the manufacturing sector capable of assessing risks, identifying an optimal set of risk mitigation actions, and predicting the additional project delay or cost based on a quantitative risk analysis. To demonstrate its validity, the model was applied to a nuclear decommissioning project currently underway in Italy, generating a forecast of the final project delay. The results showed to be promising, as the delay prediction for the analysed phase of the project differs from the current one only by an error of 4.7%. The proposed model can help project managers in managing risks and predicting delays or additional project costs during the preliminary phase.

Moreover, within a single framework, continuous updates to align with evolving standards can lead to equivalent competencies being expressed in different ways. Despite the fundamental similarity of the competencies, this divergence across frameworks can impede interoperability and complicate the aggregation of data from multiple frameworks. This paper addresses this issue by proposing an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) for mapping competency frameworks to enhance interoperability among frameworks. We investigated various pre-trained LLMs to encode competency names from each framework. Subsequently, we employed cosine similarity to measure semantic similarity scores, which facilitated the identification of equivalent or closely related competencies across different frameworks.

Issue labeling is a fundamental task for software development as it is critical for the effective management of software projects. This practice involves assigning a label to issues, such as bug or feature request, denoting a task relevant to the project management. To date, large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to automate this task, including both fine-tuned BERT-like models and zero-shot GPT-like models.
Objectives:
In this paper, we investigate which LLMs offer the best trade-off between performance, response time, hardware requirements, and quality of the responses for issue report classification.
Methods:
We design and execute a comprehensive benchmark study to assess 22 generative decoder-only LLMs and 2 baseline BERT-like encoder-only models, which we evaluate on two different datasets of GitHub issues.
Results:
Generative LLMs demonstrate potential for zero-shot classification. However, their performance varies significantly across datasets and they require substantial computational resources for deployment. In contrast, BERT-like models show more consistent performance and lower resource requirements.
Conclusions:
Based on the empirical evidence provided in this study, we discuss implications for researchers and practitioners. In particular, our results suggest that fine-tuning BERT-like encoder-only models enables achieving consistent, state-of-the-art performance across datasets even in presence of a small amount of labeled data available for training.",,0950-5849

Not only does this type of construction typically rely on very expensive heavy mechanical equipment, it also usually involves closing lanes that will inevitably cause delays to users. Although there is an increasing interest in completing these rehabilitation interventions with the lowest costs and durations, the planning of this process is currently mostly based on experience. Thus, this paper focuses on developing an optimization system based on an evolutionary multi-objective approach, capable of supporting decision making in road pavement rehabilitation planning. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold. On the one hand, it tackles an identified research gap regarding the study of the viability and the gain associated with the implementation of multi-objective optimization in planning of pavement rehabilitation projects. On the other hand, a more practical contribution is related to the development of a system capable of supporting decision making throughout design phases. The capabilities of the system are validated in a real motorway pavement rehabilitation project. Results demonstrate the ability of the system to quickly output optimal solutions, that not only support decision making, but also enhance flexibility and efficiency from the decision-maker viewpoint. The optimization system is an important contribution to more intelligent and sustainable pavement engineering, by promoting the global optimization of technical, economic and environmental objectives.",,2666-691X

This study examines the development, implementation, and evaluation of a teamwork framework by using academic integrity standards and formative feedback to minimise the use of generative AI tools in the Business Project Management (BPM) unit and promote students' learning skills through teamwork and self/peer evaluation. This teamwork assessment was designed to transform students into independent learners by improving their cultural awareness, self-confidence, teamwork, communication, leadership, as well as personal and interpersonal skills. The study's objectives are to determine whether a teamwork framework can help to maintain academic integrity and transform BPM students into independent learners and leaders in the era of generative AI, and to determine whether lecturers' formative feedback enhances students' skills in teamwork assessment. This research comprises an empirical study of 408 local and international BPM students from different cultural backgrounds. A mixed-methods approach was used to collect data and achieve a broader perspective of the research topic. BPM students reported their satisfaction with this type of assessment since it helped them acquire skills such as intercultural effectiveness and teamwork. Following the implementation of the teamwork framework, the number of instances of academic misconduct and requests for extensions have decreased dramatically, while the assessment's average marks increased by 10 %. A set of recommendations is offered that will ensure the successful implementation of the proposed framework for teamwork assessment and self/peer evaluation.

The construction industry is notorious for high risks and accident rates, prompting professionals to adopt emerging technologies for improved construction workers’ health and safety (CWHS). Despite the recognized benefits, the practical implementation of these technologies in safety management within the Construction 4.0 era remains nascent. This study aims to investigate the mechanisms influencing the implementation of Construction 4.0 technologies (C4.0TeIm) to enhance CWHS in construction organizations.
Design/methodology/approach
Drawing upon integrated institutional theory, the contingency resource-based view of firms and the theory of planned behavior, this study developed and tested an integrated C4.0TeIm-CWHS framework. The framework captures the interactions among key factors driving C4.0TeIm to enhance CWHS within construction organizations. Data were collected via a questionnaire survey among 91 construction organizations and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized relationships.
Findings
The results reveal that: (1) key C4.0TeIm areas are integrative and centralized around four areas, such as artificial intelligence and 3D printing, Internet of Things and extended reality; and (2) external coercive and normative forces, internal resource and capability, business strategy, technology competency and management (BST), organizational culture and use intention (UI) of C4.0 technologies, collectively influence C4.0TeIm-CWHS. The findings confirm the pivotal roles of BST and UI as mediators fostering positive organizational behaviors related to C4.0TeIm-CWHS.
Practical implications
Practically, it offers actionable insights for policymakers to optimize technology integration in construction firms, promoting industrial advancement while enhancing workforce well-being.
Originality/value
The novel C4.0TeIm-CWHS framework contributes to the theoretical discourses on safety management within the C4.0 paradigm by offering insights into internal strategic deployment and compliance challenges in construction organizations.",,0969-9988

Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI) may support accurate, efficient radiology diagnostics. However, little is known about implementing AI in clinical settings. In 2023, NHS England launched a programme funding 12 networks of 66 NHS Trusts to implement AI for chest diagnostics, including lung cancer.
Methods
Rapid evaluation (March–September 2024) of procurement and early deployment of AI for chest diagnostics at network (n = 10) and Trust (n = 6) levels. We interviewed network teams, Trust staff, and AI suppliers (n = 51); observed planning, governance, and training (n = 57); and analysed relevant documents (n = 166). The NASSS framework guided thematic analysis.
Findings
Procurement and deployment of AI took longer than anticipated. Procurement involved engaging selection panels, assessing tenders, and contracting AI suppliers. Preparation for deployment involved AI integration; governance processes; staff engagement and training; planning patient engagement; and collating impact data; patient communication plans varied and were still developing. Challenges included: engaging staff with high clinical workloads; staff’s limited AI knowledge, time to participate, and concerns over appropriate tool usage; managing unsuccessful suppliers’ responses; and varied local governance processes, IT systems, and data availability and quality. Enablers included: programme leadership’s support; networks sharing expertise and capacity; committed clinical, technical, and procurement specialists and AI suppliers; clinical champions; and dedicated project management.
Interpretation
Implementing AI involved complex social and technical processes, requiring significant resources. Future implementation may benefit from ensuring sufficient time and capacity, ongoing stakeholder engagement at multiple levels, and greater consideration of patients and equity, diversity, and inclusion. Influential factors identified here mirror research on other healthcare innovations, suggesting AI may not address service challenges as straightforwardly as policymakers anticipate.

Most articles in the extant literature have discussed leadership factors impacting project success; however, leadership behavioural practices encompassing characteristics/dimensions have not been considered and discussed in a unified manner. Therefore, a need arises with an objective for such a study to bridge the gap of a systematic literature review on leadership behavioural practice characteristics and provide a unified summarised effort to understand relationships with project success from relevant studies between 2000 and 2021. A sample of 72 out of 2805 articles was finally selected for rigorous analysis in a seven-step literature review process. This SLR has identified high to moderate levels of tangible managerial interpersonal and emotional behavioural practice characteristics compared to low-level task-oriented and intellectual practices on construction projects. Compelling evidence shows that relationship-building and people-oriented project leaders using effective communication and collaborative working are highly valued compared to task-oriented project leaders on successful construction projects. Effective leadership practices and findings from this SLR will provide a benchmark for future researchers to investigate further construction projects to generalize SLR outcomes on a broader scale. In addition, project organizations can use our identified cluster listings of behavioural practice characteristics during their recruitment process of project professionals. Low-valued soft skills in our analysis need more investigations in future research.",,1029-3132
