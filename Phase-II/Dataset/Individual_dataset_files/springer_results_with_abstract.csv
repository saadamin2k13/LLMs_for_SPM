Unethical behaviors of contractors in construction project management: Framework development and causal analysis,Frontiers of Engineering Management,,,,10.1007/s42524-025-4151-x,Dongping FangWenqi LiJianhua LiYiqin YuHong YangHe Liu,2025,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42524-025-4151-x,Article,"Unethical behaviors among contractors are prevalent in engineering management activities within the construction industry, significantly affecting project performance, public safety, and the industry’s reputation. Despite the urgent need to enhance the ethical performance of contractor managers, current research lacks a theoretical framework to systematically categorize and characterize these unethical behaviors. This study fills this gap by conducting semi-structured interviews with 20 experienced construction project managers in China, followed by a qualitative content analysis. The findings indicate that contractor mangers’ unethical behaviors can be organized into a framework comprising three levels, five dimensions, and 18 themes. The most common behaviors identified include “construction disturbance,” “qualification rental,” and “deception in settlement.” Additionally, the study explores the causes of these unethical behaviors, revealing power and responsibility imbalances within the supply chain and the lack of moral competencies among contractor managers in the construction industry. This study offers a theoretical taxonomy framework for contractor managers to identify and assess ethical performance in practice and provides a scientific basis for authorities to establish ethical guidelines and enhance ethical management practices in the construction industry."

Generating reliable software project task flows using large language models through prompt engineering and robust evaluation,Scientific Reports,,,,10.1038/s41598-025-19170-9,Mohammed SarimFaraz MasoodManas MaheshwariArman Rasool FaridiAli Haider Shamsan,2025,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-19170-9,Article,"Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for converting unstructured software documentation into structured task flows, yet their outputs often lack procedural reliability critical for software engineering. This paper presents a comprehensive framework that benchmarks five leading LLMs-Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok 3, GPT-Omni, DeepSeek-R1, and LLaMA-3-across five prompting strategies, including Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, and ISO 21502-Guided, using real-world software tutorials from the “Build Your Own X” repository. We introduce the Hybrid Semantic Similarity Metric (HSSM), which combines SentenceTransformer embeddings with context-aware key-term overlap, capturing both semantic fidelity and procedural coherence. Compared to traditional metrics like BERTScore, SBERT, and USE, HSSM demonstrates significantly lower variance (CV: 1.5–2.9%) and stronger correlation with human judgments. Our results show that even minimal prompting (Zero-Shot) can yield highly aligned task flows (HSSM: 96.33%) when evaluated with robust metrics. This work offers a scalable evaluation paradigm for LLM-assisted software planning, with implications for AI-driven project management, prompt engineering, and procedural generation in software education and tooling."

Initially, a questionnaire was answered by 84 respondents, followed by in-depth interviews with seven experienced project managers. The primary objective was to assess the extent of AI integration in project management practices and its perceived benefits. The findings reveal that a significant number of project managers in Norway have already incorporated AI tools into their workflows. These tools are primarily utilized for task automation, predictive analytics, and resource allocation. Project managers reported that AI significantly enhances efficiency by automating routine tasks, thereby allowing them to focus on more strategic activities. Additionally, AI tools provide valuable insights through data analysis, enabling more informed decision-making and greater project flexibility. Despite the overall positive reception, some respondents highlighted challenges such as the steep learning curve associated with new AI technologies and concerns over data security. These challenges, however, are manageable and can be addressed with proper training and robust data protection measures. The consensus is clear - AI has the potential to transform project management, making it more dynamic and adaptable to changing project demands. This study underscores the growing importance of AI in the project management domain in Norway. It suggests that ongoing advancements in AI technology will likely lead to even greater integration and reliance on these tools in the future. Further research is recommended to explore long-term impacts and the development of best practices for AI adoption in project management."

IT Project Management Complexity Framework: Managing and&#xa0;Understanding Complexity in&#xa0;IT Projects in&#xa0;a&#xa0;Remote Working Environment,"HCI in Business, Government and Organizations",,,,10.1007/978-3-031-61318-0_3,Megan Rebecca EvansTevin Moodley,2024,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-61318-0_3,Conference paper,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a sudden shift towards remote working in almost all industries, including the IT sector. Even after the lifting of lockdown restrictions, many IT companies have opted to continue with a remote or hybrid work situation. However, with the increase in remote working, new challenges have emerged, such as decreased effective communication among developers and between developers and customers. This decrease in communication can lead to misunderstandings about project requirements, system domain knowledge, and team standards and protocols, thereby increasing the risk of scope, cost, and time impediments. As technology continues to advance in the 21st century, IT project complexity naturally increases. However, a lack of understanding of the complexity of an IT system further increases the risk of project impediments. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze current Agile methodology practices and propose new or adjusted practices to mitigate the risk associated with complexity. This paper outlines an Agile framework incorporating these adjustments, which can help IT companies manage their projects more effectively and efficiently. However, further research into this topic is necessary to investigate the concept of project complexity. It is widely misunderstood, and focusing on complexity in IT projects can help IT companies better understand and manage the risks associated with complex projects. Additionally, research can be carried out on remote and hybrid working, specifically regarding team communication and misunderstanding. Such research can help companies overcome the challenges that arise due to remote working and ensure that they can continue to work efficiently and effectively even in a remote or hybrid work environment."

Therefore, helpful feedback for students is essential but difficult to provide in large university-level courses. Recent developments related to large language models (LLMs) show promising possibilities for supporting students in different educational scenarios. In this study, we developed an LLM-based mentor to aid students in designing system architectures based on textual project descriptions and technical requirements. The tool follows a Socratic method to guide students toward a possible solution by posing relevant questions and thoughts. Therefore, we developed the System Architecture Dialogue (SAD) Framework with input from 18 experienced software engineers who offered insights into their architectural development experiences. We conducted a study in a first-year project management course at a European university involving 39 students, comparing a group using the LLM-based approach with a traditional method group. We investigated the educational impact of LLMs through surveys, chat protocol analysis, and comparing final system architectures. This paper presents our findings and experiences with developing an LLM-based mentor for creating system architectures and its educational possibilities. While the study found no significant differences in the final architectures between the groups, it showed that LLMs can help reduce complexity and provide additional context by following a structured and logical approach. LLMs have the potential to broaden students’ horizons and can be a beneficial tool for early career students and software engineers."

A Project Management Framework for Improving the Business Performance of Emerging Contractors in South African Construction,Sustainable Ecological Engineering Design,,,,10.1007/978-3-031-73947-7_18,J. AkabaF. A. EmuzeE. K. Agbobli,2025,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-73947-7_18,Conference paper,"The capacity of emerging contractors (ECs) to enhance their business performance in the construction industry of South Africa has been marred by evidence of poor construction quality, delays in project execution and completion leading to cost overruns, and public frustration with ECs’ structures. These challenges are attributed to poor project management practices and the limited resources capability of most ECs. However, project business requires the use of a project management approach to support successful project outcomes. This study aimed to develop a project management framework (PMF) consisting of a project life cycle, project control cycle, tools, and templates that could improve the business performance of emerging contractors in the South African construction industry. The study draws on an explanatory sequential mixed method research design to achieve the aim of the study. Findings suggest that the PMF could consistently support ECs to define, plan, execute, and close the project they undertake, thereby successfully enhancing project outcomes. This is because the PMF offers a structured approach that supports the project management process in undertaking projects in the construction industry, leading to successful project outcomes. The paper concludes that the proposed PMF can support the drive to improve the business performance of ECs in the construction industry if ECs consider the PMF for their project activities. Thus, there is a need for the proposed PMF to be considered a working document to support the drive to improve the business performance of ECs in South African construction."

Modern software development in Industry 4.0 is complex process, both human-intensive, technology-intensive, knowledge- intensive and innovative-intensive. The modern software industry moves unrelentingly towards new methods for managing the ever-increasing complexity of software projects. The traditional project management methodology, which contains structured and standardized forms, and is focused on a greater certainty and planning horizon of several decades, no longer allows companies to fully adapt to the new opportunities, speeds and risks of Industry 4.0. The article systematizes new conceptual approaches and forms of projects management, including adaptive management methodologies. Agile-based digital project management creates new opportunities for business: accelerating decision-making and the rapid identification of incorrect approaches, effective cooperation between technical groups and business groups, creating a more attractive environment for collaboration and co-working, reducing the time to prepare documentation and others. The transformation of software project management is associated with dramatic changes, the risk of errors when updating products, diluting responsibility for product quality, and even problems with the companies reputation. Presently it seems to be more sustainable a combined or hybrid model of software projects management, combining traditional and Agile methodologies."

Lukin,2022,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-8926-0_26,Conference paper,"The necessity to maintain the workflow in the context of the forced disunity of society caused a high demand for the services provided by software systems. It suddenly turned out that the quality of many widely advertised software products is much lower than expected. One of the reasons is that a different category of users with different quality criteria started to use these products. Another reason is that products, and especially Internet projects, have drastically decreased their quality to an unacceptably low level for various reasons. The quality decrease mostly happened due to errors in project management, in particular, due to an inadequate software development methodology. Taking a look at the scale and significance of a modern software project, the desire to execute it according to one of the classic models becomes clear. It would provide quality but increase development time. However, developers’ desire to stay ahead of competitors forces them to reduce the development time, albeit with a loss of quality. Traditionally, agile methodologies have been used in this case. They dramatically reduce the “unproductive” phases of the life cycle: the formation and analysis of requirements, planning, and testing. And the larger the Internet project, the higher the risk of quality loss and the higher the cost of the loss. Finally, the project might become unacceptable. What should be done in order to avoid this? How to combine the benefits of both approaches without getting their disadvantages?"

Newcomers to a subject may struggle to find the best keywords or lack confidence in the credibility of the supplementary materials they discover. To address these problems, we introduce Slide ++ , an automated tool that identifies keywords from lecture slides, and uses them to search for relevant links, videos, and Q&As. This interactive website integrates the original slides with recommended resources, and further allows instructors to ‘pin’ the most important ones. To evaluate the effectiveness of the tool, we trialled the system in four undergraduate computing courses, and invited students to share their experiences via a survey and focus groups at the end of the term. Students shared that they found the generated links to be credible, relevant, and sufficient, and that they became more confident in their understanding of the courses. We reflect on these insights, our experience of using Slide ++ , and explore how Large Language Models might mitigate some augmentation challenges."

With the advancement and complexity of modern technology, these organisations are required to renew their fleet. However, there are no guidelines that can help these organisations to implement a disruptive technological transition from old, dilapidated depots to the desired state that can support new technology in new rolling stock fleets. In this paper a project management framework is developed for modernising passenger railway depots to support the new rolling stock fleet and realise efficiency gains. To realise efficiency gains, the railway depots are viewed as large technical systems. Data was collected by conducting a systematic literature review and interviews with subject matter experts from industry. The project environment for railway depots is multidisciplinary hence the framework is developed to be robust for accommodating different project landscapes. Due to the complexity of railway systems, the framework offers the necessary flexibility to accommodate different project dynamics. The feedback mechanism in the framework ensures project flexibility without compromising on control. The goal of modernisation is to achieve sustainability through several objectives, namely supportability, interoperability, systems performance improvement, maintenance optimisation and productivity improvement. These objectives are integrated in a customised work breakdown structure which forms part of the framework and which facilitates concurrent execution of projects by different teams in a closely coordinated decentralised framework. With the developed project management framework, the process of modernisation becomes integrated, the delivery performance is improved and lean methodologies are easily implemented thereby improving the competitiveness of the modernisation plan."

DLTs and blockchain in particular allows industries to utilize distributed peer-to-peer networks where non-fully-trusting members may interact with each other without relying on the assistance of a trusted 3rd party. These interactions are kept verifiable and auditable both from the participants in the process and external players. One unexploited use of blockchain is in the area of SLM. Here providers of software products and services could benefit of some natural DLT properties. First: Establishing secure communications between non-fully trusted participants of the SLM processes and reducing the risks from malicious code reaching customer sites and their productive systems. Second: It would allow sharing of SLM resources and services between involved parties thus greatly improving the overall interaction costs required for complex multi-party procedures. Third: The system would allow better time and resource prediction for upcoming SLM procedures by keeping history execution data from previous runs of the same or similar procedures. Using DLT in SLM would allow simplification and automation of existing complex and time-consuming procedures in a cryptographically verifiable manner. Also, in some cases payments for new software or financial penalties for unplanned downtimes or other SLA infringements could be executed automatically."

Juárez-Ramírez,2024,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0361768824700774,Article,"Abstract This article explores the potential of chatbots to bridge the gap for students transitioning from structured programming to object-oriented programming (OOP). We delve into the advantages and disadvantages of using chatbots like ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0, Gemini, and Bing to assist with OOP learning. While these tools offer benefits like providing code examples and explanations, limitations exist in accurate problem interpretation and adherence to best practices. Building upon the previous student-focused analysis, we present the results of a new survey targeting software engineering teachers: ‘Survey on the Use of AI Chatbots in Teaching Software Engineering’. This survey sheds light on how educators integrate chatbots into their curriculum and their perspectives on their effectiveness. The original student survey revealed positive impressions of chatbots as study aids, with a high percentage utilizing and finding them valuable. The teacher survey will provide further insights into their role in the teaching and learning process, ultimately contributing to the development of more efficient software engineers. Recognizing and addressing the limitations of chatbots remains crucial to maximizing their potential in OOP education. This paper is an extension of work originally presented in Conisoft 2023 [1]."
Hybridisation of IT Project Management Methodologies. Complementary or Contradictory?,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing V,,,,10.1007/978-3-030-63270-0_22,Sergey BushuyevVictoria BushuievaDenis BushuievNanaliya Bushuyeva,2021,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-63270-0_22,Conference paper,"The subject of this article is the development of hybrid methodologies for managing IT projects, programs and project portfolios. Significant reductions in the life cycles of programs, which contain projects of different lines of activity and different management methodologies, for example, waterfalls with a rigid life cycle and Agile with a flexible methodology life cycle, require the use of convergence tools to form “hybrid” methodologies. The goal is to develop a convergent approach to building hybrid project management methodologies in terms of decision-making processes in project management based on various platforms. Results of the studies were obtained using a convergent approach to building methodologies for managing projects and programs. A substantial model of the resulting hybrid methodology for managing projects and programs is presented. Conclusions: Hybrid methodologies for managing projects and programs are becoming more popular in this category of programs. The main reason is the presence in the program of components with different life cycles, and, consequently, methodologies that require integration and harmonization. The methodology is tested by the practice of using mechanisms of hybrid multilevel management of projects and programs. The study of hybrid infrastructural program management methodologies is defined by the practice of introducing different components of programs. The application of the hybrid project management methodology allowed the authors to execute different projects in essence within the stipulated timeframe with the given budget and quality of construction projects and projects of creation of information and communication management systems. Further areas of research are related to the elaboration of harmonization, integration, convergence and actualization mechanisms."
Prediction of failures in the project management knowledge areas using optimized ensemble models in software companies,Discover Applied Sciences,,,,10.1007/s42452-025-07337-y,Lamia BerricheAbderrazak Loulizi,2025,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-025-07337-y,Article,"Project management involves coordinating various tasks and phases to achieve specific goals. Artificial Intelligence has the potential to enhance decision-making by providing data-driven insights. However, its application in project management, especially for predicting project failures, is still not widespread. This study investigates how hyperparameter tuning and ensemble learning techniques can improve the accuracy of predicting project failures. We applied grid search to optimize several classical machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, with average accuracies of 92.46, 93.61, 93.60, and 84.74%, respectively. Our optimized classical machine learning models’ accuracies outperformed state-of-the-art techniques. To further improve performance, ensemble techniques such as soft voting, hard voting, and stacking were explored. Combinatorial optimization was used to identify the most effective set of base learners for ensemble methods. The best soft voting combination—DT, KNN, LR, and CatBoost—achieved an accuracy of 93.21%. The stacking model with DT, KNN, and LR as base-learners and SVM as the meta-learner performed best, reaching 93.73%. CatBoost demonstrated the best accuracy, achieving 94.02%, and demonstrated the best generalization. These models showed strong performance in predicting failures related to scope and cost management but were less accurate when predicting failures in human resource management. Finally, the SHAP model showed that the ‘Reason for Fail’ feature demonstrated the largest impact on the prediction of all classes, while the project manager’s education is an important predictor of cost overruns."

Mixed reality can provide a new way of combining remote collaboration with innovative 3D visualizations to analyze the project status. In this paper, we present a visual immersive analytics framework for project management (VIAProMa). It imports data from project management tools like the GitHub issue tracker for open-source projects. With these task data as the basis, it can generate three-dimensional visualizations, e.g. about the overall progress or the competences of individual developers. Developers, stakeholders and end users can meet in the collaborative virtual environment as avatars and establish a spatial structure with the task cards and visualizations. Therefore, VIAProMa with its adapted and customized mixed reality project management features supports both the shared meetings and the information flow in the project. The shared environment makes it a suitable tool for DevOpsUseXR, an extension to the DevOps workflow, where end users are able to participate in the development process in mixed reality. The resulting implementation is available as an open-source project with cross-platform capabilities targeting the Microsoft HoloLens, HTC VIVE and Android smartphones, as well as tablets. The framework is applied in university teaching classes to convey agile methodology in mixed reality programming practices."

Software size is the major factor determining cost, time, and effort for developing software applications. The successful completion of all the activities of SPM requires an accurate determination of the cost, time, and effort required for developing the application. That is, the real size of the software application is the major determinant of all the SPM activities. The existing traditional application-oriented and single-dimensional software sizing techniques will not give the actual size of modern software applications like artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics (BDA). The imperfect estimation leads to wrong predictions about the cost, time, and effort required for software application development. The wrong estimates will affect the entire SPM activities, resulting in a delay in delivery, a loss in predicted cost, an imbalanced effort level, and the dismissal of the software development process. The major software industries are facing the same problem with wrong size estimates. The updated and dynamic new size estimation technique is highly essential for this current SPM environment. The novel approach of modern metrics (MM) addresses all the technical challenges facing software engineering for the software size estimation process. This article analyses the major issues of the software size estimation process, major functional and non-functional units associated with software size estimation, the architecture of MM, and an algorithm for software size estimation using MM."

Consequently, there has been a shift from a more experience-based approach to a data-driven decision-making approach. This shift to data-driven decision-making has resulted in more reliable and accurate decision-making, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective SE processes and a reduction in rework. Our study involved a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) examining the utilization of data-driven approaches in SE processes over the last decade. Our analysis of 34 primary studies revealed that data-driven approaches are most commonly utilized. After analyzing the primary studies, we found that data-driven methods are commonly employed in SE processes for software management and software testing. Researchers are delving into subfields of artificial intelligence, including machine learning and deep learning, to devise decision-making models for SE processes that have undergone extensive validation. We aim to provide valuable insights into the usage of data-driven approaches in SE by conducting a systematic mapping based on the studies that we have found."

At present, various intelligent optimization algorithms have provided many feasible solutions to the course scheduling problem in colleges and universities, with differentiated advantages and disadvantages. This work tries to design a general and efficient algorithm to solve the large-scale course scheduling. In particular, we analyze and model the problem of course scheduling in colleges and universities, and put forward the improved genetic algorithm to solve the problem of large course scheduling under various constraints. First, the teaching task number is stored in a two-dimensional time-class matrix, which represents the information of teachers, and a two-dimensional classroom matrix is established to store the classroom information of the class. Next, we apply the improved genetic algorithm to cross and mutate the time-class matrix to obtain new individuals, thereby adjusting the corresponding classroom matrix. Then, the excellent individual is selected from the parent and child generation, and iterated until the optimal individual is produced. Finally, experimental results show that the convergence speed of the proposed algorithm is faster and higher fitness values can be obtained."

Businesses need to be more responsive to competitive environments and customers’ requirements. Business agility involves implementing agile practices across organizational functions. Agile processes are especially critical in IT Service Management (ITSM). When agile processes are implemented to meet changing business and customer demands in ITSM environments, the speed and leanness characterizing agile practices often lead to agile practices not always explicitly addressing all underlying risks. Customer demands for fast solutions often means that risks are not attended to with necessary thoroughness. Some risks are not apparent and these concealed risks need to be revealed and managed. The failure to completely address risks involves errors of commission and errors of omission. Coupling agile business, agile systems development, and agile ITSM practices with effective risk management approaches within the agile framework is a suggested approach to manage risk in this evolving environment."

The research highlights key challenges faced by retailers in retaining and motivating employees in the face of technological advancements and ever-changing consumer behaviour. It articulates how technology contributes to low or high employee morale. Herzberg’s two-factor theory is a relevant tool for the study as it provides a framework for understanding the factors that influence employee motivation and job satisfaction in the retail industry. A mixed-methods approach involving both qualitative and quantitative research techniques is used. A purposive sampling technique is used to select participants. The data are analysed using descriptive statistics and frequency analysis. The quantitative data gathered from the surveys are analysed using descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, and frequency distribution. Thematic analysis was used to examine the qualitative information gathered from the interviews. Gamification, employee recognition, rewards, incentives, and providing access to developmental training sessions on new technologies could encourage employee participation. The right working conditions (such as expertly designed ergonomics) and clear company policies all play a crucial role in fostering employee satisfaction. Other hygiene-related factors, including compensation that is in proportion with employee efforts, job security through carefully drafted contracts or agreements with business partners, or management teams that foster trust and confidence in the organization’s overall direction, help build worker loyalty. Workers’ engagement may decline if these factors are ignored. By addressing both hygiene factors and motivators, the study provides innovative strategies for boosting employee morale and improving job satisfaction in the age of digital technology. The insights derived from this research could be useful in advising retailers to seek holistic employee engagement strategies that combine interpersonal communication with digital technology tools while fostering a work environment that can increase employee satisfaction and boost turnover."

Additionally, the NESMA (Netherlands Software Metrics Users Association) method, from the functional families approach, will be in focus, where the ISBSG (International Software Benchmarking Standards Group) dataset, which provides standardized and relevant data for comparing software performance, was used to analyze 1704 industrial software projects. The goal was to identify the graph architecture with the smallest number of experiments to be performed and the lowest Mean Magnitude Relative Error (MMRE) using orthogonal-array tuning optimization via Latin Square extraction. In the proposed approach, the number of experiments is fewer than 8 for each dataset, and a minimum MMRE value of 0.97% was obtained using PSI-GNN. Additionally, the impact of five input features on the change in MMRE value was analyzed with the top-performing model, employing the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature importance method, visualized through GraphExplainer. The frequency of user-initiated transactions, quantified technically, emerged as the most significant determinant within the NESMA framework."

State of the Art on User Story Mapping and Scenarios to Specify Software Requirements,Computer Science – CACIC 2024,,,,10.1007/978-3-032-00718-6_15,Andrea AlegrettiMarisa PanizziLeandro Antonelli,2026,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-032-00718-6_15,Conference paper,"Requirements engineering is vital to software development, by ensuring software products comply with clients’ needs. However, it faces significant challenges, such as failures due to deficiencies in requirements specification, accounting for up to 47% of all failures in software projects. In order to mitigate these problems, adequately capturing the user’s domain knowledge and needs through Natural Language models, such as User Story Mapping (USM) and Scenarios becomes essential. This paper presents the state of the art on these two tools for software requirements specification. First, a systematic mapping study (SMS) is conducted and this is complemented by an exploratory study based on a survey in order to collect evidence on the current state of practice on the use of the User Story Mapping and Scenarios tools for requirements specification in the software industry. The results of both studies showed that USM and Scenarios are key tools in requirements specification and that using them complementarily enhances accuracy and clarity. Their direct relationship makes it possible to efficiently structure and prioritize needs, by optimizing communication between teams and enhancing the ability of projects to be adapted to the client’s requirements, thus establishing an innovative path in requirements engineering."

A systematic review of transfer learning in software engineering,Multimedia Tools and Applications,,,,10.1007/s11042-024-19756-x,Ruchika MalhotraShweta Meena,2024,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-024-19756-x,Article,"Nowadays, everyone requires a good quality software. The quality of software can’t be assured due to lack of data availability for training, and testing. Thus, Transfer Learning (TL) plays an important role in the reusability of existing software for developing new software with a similar domain and task. TL focused on transferring knowledge from existing prediction models for the development of new prediction models. The developed models are used for unseen datasets based on the characteristics, and nature of the dataset. The sufficient amount of training data is unavailable. The data distribution and task of the source and target project must be checked before employing TL for software development. In this Systematic Review (SR), we have investigated 39 studies from January 1990 to March 2024 that used TL in the software engineering domain. The review focused on the identification of Machine Learning (ML) techniques used with TL techniques, types of TL explored, TL settings explored, experimental setting, dataset, quality attribute, validation methods, threats to validity, strengths and weakness of TL techniques, and hybrid techniques with TL. According to the experimental comparison, the performance of TL techniques is encouraging. The findings of this SR paper will serve as guidelines for academicians, software industry experts, software developers, software testers, and researchers. This SR is also helpful in the selection of appropriate types of TL and TL settings for the development of efficient software in the future based on the type of problem and TL setting. Thus, this study showed that 30.67% of the studies are focused on defect prediction, that used 15% open-source dataset. Further, 35% of studies used SVM as a base classifier for TL, and different independent variables of the used dataset are considered as prediction model input. Further, the K -fold Cross-Validation (CV) method is used in 15 studies."

However, existing studies on software project scheduling usually overlook such new skill demands. This paper designs the learning mechanism targeting the treatment of new skills for project employees, including how to select appropriate employees to learn new skills, the growth curves of new skill proficiencies and the adaptive dedication changes for the selected employees. Three common dynamic events are considered to establish a mathematical model for the dynamic software project scheduling problem considering the new skill learning. To solve the model, a multi-population coevolutionary algorithm-based predictive-reactive scheduling method is proposed in this paper. Three novel strategies are incorporated, which include a response mechanism to environmental changes, a population grouping strategy based on dual indicators, and a dynamic allocation of subpopulation size according to the variation trend of contribution. Systematic experimental results based on ten synthetic instances and three real-world instances show that when dynamic events occur, the proposed algorithm can quickly reschedule the tasks with a better duration, cost and stability compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms, helping project manager make a more informed decision."

An ability to abstract from specific knowledge to form insights and also gain the expertise to realize practical implementations from abstracted models are the essential traits of a learned engineer or scientist. I have had nearly 30 years of experience of working in technology organizations, as well as a Learner-Teacher in a university teaching working professionals for the past 12 years. As part of this autoethnographic experiment, starting afresh as a student to learn new subjects which are different from my earlier academic credentials or past profession, I have accumulated several insights on the way I experienced learning along with the roadblocks to my understanding of the subjects. While a Teacher can afford to be a specialist or expert in one discipline of knowledge or the other, a Student on the other hand, would have to assimilate different courses being delivered in a disjointed manner by individual instructors in their own scheduled periods. Being empathetic to students’ cognitive barriers and delivering instruction as a symphony or synergistic portfolio of courses aligned to their mental bandwidth in a progressive bite-sized chunks of instruction is the key to effective assimilation of knowledge. By listening to the voices and noises in my head while studying new courses and analyzing my subject notes and diaries over the last 12 years of Learning-Teaching of electrical engineering and computer science courses, this paper highlights key observations and recommendations for effective instruction in STEM education based on my proposed SLATE (Structured Learning and Thinking Enablement) framework and Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). Whatever measures, observations and recommendations proposed in this lone experiment-on-myself are neither well-defined, conclusive or comprehensive. They’re mere thought triggers.

Software firms constantly experiment with new methodologies to define and assess software quality to stay competitive and ensure excellence. Software engineering uses fundamentals and cutting-edge technology to develop great software. In recent decades, Data-mining techniques and machine learning for classifying problematic software projects have emerged to improve software quality. ML approaches, especially ensemble learning models, are becoming fundamental to software engineers’ daily jobs. This work created a binary white shark optimizer (WSO) to optimize standard ensemble learning models. The objective is to identify the most suitable ensemble number for weak learners to maximize accuracy on benchmark datasets. The EM model uses 14 weak learners. Twenty-one experimental runs are performed on 15 software-defective module datasets. The optimized ensemble model outperforms the standard Ensemble learning model in AUC-ROC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Specificity. The enhanced model has an average accuracy of 86%, compared to 76% for the standard ensemble model across all datasets. The optimized model outperformed the conventional ensemble for the same datasets, with an average AUC of 72% compared to 61% for the standard ensemble. The optimized model was more stable than the standard model, with an STD of 5.53E−03 vs 7.24E−02 for the ensemble model. The WSO optimization process strengthens and generalizes optimizeels. The study suggests that evolutionary metaheuristic approaches can enhance EM models’ accuracy, trustworthiness, and adaptability."

The data gathered throughout the study serve as the cornerstone for important choices about complexity, resources, frameworks, timetables, costs, etc. Numerous methods have been developed throughout time to make the project analysis phase simpler, but most of them are still insufficient when it comes to the accuracy of the results. Without a precise analysis technique in place, even initiatives with clear goals might unravel in the later stages. Software project management still faces challenges in producing accurate and trustworthy estimates of software effort, particularly in the early stages of the software life cycle when the information available is more categorical than numerical. Predicting the number of person-hours, or months, required for software development is seen as a difficult task in Software Effort Estimation (SEE). Project cancellation or project failure is the outcome of overestimating or underestimating the software effort. Although useful sizing tools and methods derived from function points don't take into consideration the unique project management culture of a business. Data processing techniques are being investigated as a substitute estimation method as a result of these shortcomings in recent years. This research aims to propose a mixture method of functional sizing measurement and three data processing methods for effort estimation at the first stage of projects: Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNN), and Decision Trees - Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). These models’ estimation accuracies were contrasted so as to assess their potential value for implementation within businesses. Additionally, a combined strategy that mixes the output of the many algorithms is usually recommended so as to enhance prediction accuracy and forestall the incidence of over-fitting."

In educational scenarios, an educational institution usually builds a team of students with different skills to attend a competition, in which team communication cost and team benefit are two main concerns. Nevertheless, both educational fairness and student conflicts should be taken into account when forming a team for a competition. Furthermore, in forming a team for a competition, a successful team should be robust to avoid the risk of team members’ departure. This paper aims to form a robust team for a competition taking into account educational fairness and student conflicts. Firstly, the authors establish a team formation model for a competition in which robustness, educational fairness, and student conflicts are simultaneously considered. In the model, we formalize a robust team formation problem, in which team robustness and student conflicts are described as constraints, and team communication cost, team skill-benefit and the team fairness are handled as the objective function. The higher the objective function value, the better the team formed. Secondly, we design a genetic algorithm with partial repair operators (PR-GA for short) to form a robust team, in which the parameter repair probability determines the probability of changing an infeasible solution to a feasible one. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. We investigate the impact of repair probability on the formed team. The results show that with an increase in the repair probability, the objective function value of the formed team arises with the cost of increasing the running time of the algorithm. In addition, for a given set of students, the objective function value and the size of the team formed by all algorithms increase with increasing robustness parameter. In addition, for a given set of students, the running time of all algorithms increases with the increase of the robustness parameter. Although slightly worse than AR-GA (a genetic algorithm that repairs all infeasible solutions) in terms of objective function value, our proposed PR-GA consumes less running time for all instances. In general, our PR-GA has a shorter running time with a 22.3% decrease compared to AR-GA. Moreover, our PR-GA holds the second best in terms of team size and convergence speed."

With the recent technological advances in natural language processing and machine learning, an increasing number of task-oriented virtual assistants have been developed. However, due to the well-known complexity and difficulties of the natural language understanding problem, it is challenging to manage a task-oriented virtual assistant software project. Meanwhile, the management and experience related to the development of virtual assistants are hardly studied or shared in the research community or industry, to the best of our knowledge. To bridge this knowledge gap, in this paper, we share our experience and the lessons that we have learned at managing a task-oriented virtual assistant software project at Microsoft. We believe that our practices and the lessons learned can provide a useful reference for other researchers and practitioners who aim to develop a virtual assistant system. Finally, we have developed a requirement management tool, named SpecSpace, which can facilitate the management of virtual assistant projects."
An enhanced salp swarm optimizer boosted by local search algorithm for modelling prediction problems in software engineering,Artificial Intelligence Review,,,,10.1007/s10462-023-10618-w,Sofian KassaymehSalwani AbdullahMohammed Azmi Al-BetarMohammed AlweshahAmer Abu SalemSharif Naser MakhadmehMohammad Atwah Al-Ma’aitah,2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-023-10618-w,Article,"Scientific communities are still motivated to create novel approaches and methodologies for early estimation of software project development efforts and testing efforts in soft computing environments due to scheduling and budgetary concerns. Therefore, the software engineering prediction problems (SEPPs) are formulated as machine learning (ML) models with the aim of addressing these issues. In such methodologies that may exhibit significant limitations and drawbacks, efficient metaheuristic approaches are essential to improving prediction performance. Accordingly, this study aims to address software test effort prediction (STP) and software development effort prediction (SEP) with the aim of maximizing prediction accuracy, which in turn minimizes overall project costs and optimizes resource allocation. To achieve this goal, we developed several ML models composed of a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). The proposed models contain the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), which is utilized to replace the traditional network training method and tackle its limitations. The models also contain the great deluge (GD) local search algorithm, which is hybridized with the SSA algorithm to enhance optimization capabilities by finding more balance between exploration and exploitation. During the validation stage of this study, fourteen benchmark datasets were utilized to evaluate the developed models for each of the respective problems. The obtained results were quantified using eight performance metrics and compared across two sections. In the first section, a comparison was made between the results of the hybrid-developed model (HSSA) and those of the standard SSA algorithm and BPNN. In the second comparison, the performance of the HSSA model was compared with several contemporary techniques that are considered state-of-the-art. The evaluation shows that the HSSA performs better than related approaches in most cases for both problems. Finally, additional analysis was performed on the collected results, including examinations of statistical significance, distribution through box plots, and model convergence behavior."

The agile process, however, creates unique challenges when applied to developing complex systems of systems with multiple stakeholders. Because agile management is a goal and not a predefined process, system developers need strategies to maintain the effectiveness of agile development. This research identifies challenges to system development and uses systems engineering (SE) principles to apply decision analysis and systems engineering methods (decision hierarchy, IDEF0, and swim lane diagram) to an agile project management framework. These methods facilitate the documentation of requirements, processes, ownership, and progress among multiple groups to enable a shared understanding and more effective progress reporting."

We conducted an international, multi-centred randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine if adding balance training to PR would reduce the incidence of falls in people with COPD. While there have been many trials investigating the effectiveness of PR, few have involved international collaboration. Successful execution of rehabilitation trials requires a significant investment of time, staffing, and resources. With the recent completion of the Balance Training for Fall Reduction in COPD RCT, we report on the design, implementation, and execution of our trial using project management phases. We also highlight our lessons learned for consideration in future multi-centre rehabilitation trials. Methods This was a retrospective review of the planning, preparation, timelines, and personnel training involved in the execution of this study using four of the five project management phases described by Farrell et al. in 2010: (1) initiation, (2) planning, (3) execution, and (4) monitoring and controlling. We report descriptive statistics as percentages and counts and summarize our lessons learned. Results Ten outpatient PR programs in three continents participated. Thirty-one personnel worked on the trial across all sites. Enrolment began in January 2017 and was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 1275 patients were screened, 455 (36%) were eligible, 258 (57%) consented, 243 (53%) participated, and 130 (61%) completed the 12-month follow-up assessment. Lessons learned through our experience included (1) ensuring awareness of funder policies and considering the impact on collaborating sites; (2) preparing for the possibility of human resource and program disruptions; (3) anticipating site dropout and having a contingency plan in place; (4) planning and monitoring process measure data before, during, and after trial initiation; (5) ensuring frequent and consistent communication with and between collaborating sites; (6) maximizing features of database platform to ensure data set completeness and controlled data access; and (7) identifying strategies for increasing patient engagement in a high-demand study. Conclusions We identify seven lessons learned through our experience conducting an international, multicentre rehabilitation-based RCT. These lessons can provide guidance to other trialists conducting studies with similar logistics and may assist with future trial planning and implementation."

In this sense, the EM projects have a lifecycle that starts with initiation and ends with the closing phase. We use a project management assurance (PMA) lens to argue that like any other project, there are risks at each phase of an emergency management project and these need to be understood and addressed during the management process. Thus, in this paper, we propose a Risk and Control Assurance framework applied for project activities during the stages of the emergency management process. We propose two Emergency Project Management (EPM) models from a PMA perspective: First, Project Model 1 illustrates EM projects that encompass all organizational routines within EM, including planning, preparation, response, recovery, and the mitigation of disaster impacts. Second, Project Model 2 encompasses software or tool support development intended to facilitate the tasks of emergency management practitioners across various stages of the lifecycle of emergency management."

Students learn through the gradual implementation of iterative projects with information exchange between team members. Agility is above all a mindset. Being agile is quite simply being able to adapt to an environment that changes. Furthermore, various research works focused on the assessment of innovative teaching methods to promote the acquisition of new professional skills (e.g. project-based learning, active and collaborative learning, smart learning, etc.). In addition, adaptive learning is a pedagogical method favoring tailor-made e-learning to respond to the acquisition of certain skills, through the adaptation of pedagogical resources according to the learners’ needs. Therefore, to establish a model based on these different methods to benefit from their advantages, we based our work on the Business Process Management approach, which constitutes the means of implementing thedesired agility in the learning process. Thanks to such a cyclical and continuous improvement approach, the learning process will evolve and take into account both the needs and the specificities of the involved actors (learners or teachers). We implemented our learning process and applied Process Mining techniques to foster the adoption of “Smart Education”. We also attempted to ensure learning process adaptability based on the scrutiny of the log files obtained throughprevious executions of our learning process."

It is the need of every software organization to complete their software project development within the stipulated schedule and budget effectively; to accomplish this, traditional approaches are quite insufficient to model their current needs. Overestimation and underestimation of software development effort may cause financial implications in the form of cost of staffing, resources and the budget of the software project. Thus, there is always a constant need of a suitable and defined model of soft computing which can combined to estimate accurately and predict the effort or cost in time. In presented article, the soft computing approaches or machine learning (ML) approaches, e.g., linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), multilayer perceptron or artificial neural networks (ANNs), ensemble learning viz. decision tree (DT), random forest, etc., are used and compared for evaluating the accurate effort estimation model, and various error evaluation metrics are computed and documented. For this, we have taken a prominent dataset into consideration which is Chinese dataset (499) standard project instances. After training and testing the datasets, it was obtained that the mean absolute error (MAE), magnitude of error relative to the estimate (MER), median of MRE (MdMRE), mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE) and PRED (25) for decision tree and random forest were significantly better than the existing listed techniques. Thus, these techniques could be taken into consideration for enhancing and improving the estimation accuracy of traditional effort estimation models while calculating effort, so that software organization meets their budget accordingly."

RUL serves as a vital decision-making tool for contingency planning, guiding the timing and nature of system maintenance. Historically, PHM has primarily been applied to hardware systems, with its application to software only recently explored. In a recent study we introduced a methodology and demonstrated how changes in software can impact the RUL of software. However, in practical software development, real-time performance is also influenced by various environmental attributes, including operating systems, clock speed, processor performance, RAM, machine core count and others. This research extends the analysis to assess how changes in environmental attributes, such as operating system and clock speed, affect RUL estimation in software. Findings are rigorously validated using real performance data from controlled test beds and compared with predictive model-generated data. Statistical validation, including regression analysis, supports the credibility of the results. The controlled test bed environment replicates and validates faults from real applications, ensuring a standardized assessment platform. This exploration yields actionable knowledge for software maintenance and optimization strategies, addressing a significant gap in the field of software health management."

Inadequate knowledge about final requirements and the presence of imprecise and vague requirements are among the primary causes of unreliable estimations in this field. Though several techniques and models for effort and cost estimation have been proposed in recent years, improving their accuracy has always been a contentious topic, and researchers' efforts in this field continue. This study aims to compare and evaluate the effort estimation performance of four distinct approaches: Localized Neighbourhood Mutual Information based neural network (LNI-NN), Neuro-fuzzy logic (NFL), Adaptive GA-based neural network (AGANN), and GEHO-based NFN (GEHO-NFN). All four modeling approaches were tested & validated on five distinct datasets, namely cocomo81, cocomonasa1, cocomonasa v2, desharnais, and china datasets selected from the promise database. All the results for software effort estimation were compared, and output was evaluated using performance assessment metrics such as MMRE (Mean magnitude of relative error), MdMRE (Median of Magnitude relative error), RMSE (Root mean square error), and PRED (Prediction accuracy).

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated transformative potential to usher a new wave of precision oncology. Pathomics, an AI-based digital pathology technique, facilitates the extraction of extensive datasets from whole-slide histopathological images, enabling quantitative analyses to improve diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic prediction for HCC. Furthermore, emerging pathological foundation models are revolutionizing traditional paradigms and providing a robust framework for the development of specialized pathomics models tailored to specific clinical tasks in HCC. Despite its promise, pathomics research in HCC remains in its infancy, with clinical implementation hindered by challenges such as data heterogeneity, model interpretability, ethical concerns, regulatory issues, and the absence of standardized industry protocols.

This paper aims to propose a novel project risk management framework both to evaluate the project risks and to predict the success or failure of software projects based on their risk. This new framework uses Machine Learning (ML) and Multi-Attribute Decision-Making under a cloud model to effectively manage uncertainty. Based on the proposed framework, in the first stage, the important risks of the software projects are identified by an organized approach. Then, the risks are evaluated based on their probability and impacts on time, cost, and quality. In the second stage, the obtained results of the previous stage are entered into a new COPRAS method under the cloud model to rank the risks. Then, the risks are classified into various groups according to their rank. It helps project managers to gain a profound awareness of their high-priority project risks. In this paper, data on risks for fifty software projects has been collected. All the steps of the second stage are implemented on these projects in order to assess their risks. As a result, a data set whose features are nine types of software project risks and the label of success or failure of the projects is created. To recognize the pattern between risks’ values and the success or failure of the projects, various efficient ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest, and AdaBoost are applied. This framework can predict the success or failure of software projects based on their risks with good accuracy. The results depict that the Naive Bayes algorithm has the best results compared to others."

Inaccurate predictions will cause many software project tasks to be completed ahead of schedule or beyond budget. In this article, we propose an effective software effort and cost estimation model based on fuzzy C-means clustering and meta-heuristic evolution techniques. First, the proposed model uses two well-known statistical methods (Pearson correlation coefficient and one-way analysis of variance) to select cost adjustment factors that are highly correlated with the actual effort. Then, the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm with three cluster heads is used to group similar projects in the COCOMO-81 data set. Further, an improved self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm is used to optimize the constructive cost model parameters. The proposed model is used to accurately predict effort by minimizing errors related to mean absolute relative error, mean magnitude error relative, root mean square error, and maximizing the PRED(25%). We used the COCOMO-81 dataset to evaluate and experimental result analysis. The proposed algorithm achieves better cost prediction as compared to the other benchmark algorithms of differential evolution and non-differential evolution optimization models."

Conversely, there are few research that try to evaluate how well deep learning techniques work in SEE. This can be attributed to the relatively small sizes of SEE datasets. The goal of the study is to establish a threshold for small-sized datasets in SEE. Additionally, it looks into how well certain deep learning and traditional machine learning models perform on small-sized datasets. From the body of existing literature, plausible SEE datasets are extracted and ranked along with their attributes and number of project cases. The ranking of the project instances is discretized into three classes (small, medium, and large) using Eubank’s optimal spacing theory. Using the leave-one-out cross-validation, each small-sized dataset is used to train two deep learning models and five conventional machine learning models. Each model’s ability to make predictions is evaluated using its mean absolute error. Results show that, on small-scale datasets, deep learning models outperform traditional machine learning models in terms of prediction accuracy, which contradicts what is previously known. Regularisation techniques can be used in conjunction with deep learning to address SEE."

Analysing a diverse range of data, we observe a positive correlation between employee experience, skills, and project allocation ratings. The findings suggest that these variables exert a greater influence than traditional factors like age or educational background. We also demonstrate the benefits of leveraging historical performance data for future project planning and the utility of tracking ratings during project development. This paper contributes valuable insights for practitioners in IT project management, offering data-driven strategies to improve resource allocation and performance monitoring."
Ensemble Model of Machine Learning for Integrating Risk in Software Effort Estimation,Congress on Intelligent Systems,,,,10.1007/978-981-16-9416-5_46,Ramakrishnan NatarajanK. Balachandran,2022,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-9416-5_46,Conference paper,"The development of software involves expending a significant quantum of time, effort, cost, and other resources, and effort estimation is an important aspect. Though there are many software estimation models, risks are not adequately considered in the estimation process leading to wide gap between the estimated and actual efforts. Higher the level of accuracy of estimated effort, better would be the compliance of the software project in terms of completion within the budget and schedule. This study has been undertaken to integrate risk in effort estimation process so as to minimize the gap between the estimated and the actual efforts. This is achieved through consideration of risk score as an effort driver in the computation of effort estimates and formulating a machine learning model. It has been identified that risk score reveals feature importance and the predictive model with integration of risk score in the effort estimates indicated an enhanced fit."

While the most recent literature focuses on the role and influence of digital servitization and PSS theory, very few papers have introduced the need for investigating the lifecycle management of PSS offerings. The early contributions focus on lifecycle management frameworks and are mainly based on academic data, thus needing proper industrial validation. Therefore, this paper explores practitioners’ challenges related to the three main types of PSS offerings: product-oriented, use-oriented, and result-oriented. The paper’s results are based on insights generated by expert interviews from different industries. The results show a need for a systematic approach to the lifecycle management of digitally-enabled PSS offerings, especially for use- and result-oriented offerings.

Gamification of business process modeling education: an experimental analysis,Software and Systems Modeling,,,,10.1007/s10270-024-01171-3,Giacomo GaraccioneRiccardo CoppolaLuca ArditoMarco Torchiano,2024,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10270-024-01171-3,Article,"Gamification, the practice of using game elements in non-recreational contexts to increase user participation and interest, has been applied more and more throughout the years in software engineering. Business process modeling is a skill considered fundamental for software engineers, with Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) being one of the most commonly used notations for this discipline. BPMN modeling is present in different curricula in specific Master’s Degree courses related to software engineering but is usually seen by students as an unappealing or uninteresting activity. Gamification could potentially solve this issue, though there have been no relevant attempts in research yet. This paper aims at collecting preliminary insights on how gamification affects students’ motivation in performing BPMN modeling tasks and—as a consequence—their productivity and learning outcomes. A web application for modeling BPMN diagrams augmented with gamification mechanics such as feedback, rewards, progression, and penalization has been compared with a non-gamified version that provides more limited feedback in an experiment involving 200 students. The diagrams modeled by the students are collected and analyzed after the experiment. Students’ opinions are gathered using a post-experiment questionnaire. Statistical analysis showed that gamification leads students to check more often for their solutions’ correctness, increasing the semantic correctness of their diagrams, thus showing that it can improve students’ modeling skills. The results, however, are mixed and require additional experiments in the future to fine-tune the tool for actual classroom use."
Cost Adjustment for Software Crowdsourcing Tasks Using Ensemble Effort Estimation and Topic Modeling,Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering,,,,10.1007/s13369-024-08746-8,Anum Yasmin,2024,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13369-024-08746-8,Article,"Crowdsourced software development (CSSD) is a fast-growing field among software practitioners and researchers from the last two decades. Despite being a favorable environment, no intelligent mechanism exists to assign price to CSSD tasks. Software development effort estimation (SDEE) on the other hand is already an established field in traditional software engineering. SDEE is largely facilitated by machine learning (ML), particularly, ML-based ensemble effort estimation (EEE) which targets accurate estimate by avoiding biases of single ML model. This accuracy of EEE can be exploited for CSSD platforms to establish intelligent cost assignment mechanism. This study aims to integrate EEE with CSSD platform to provide justified costing solution for crowdsourced tasks. Effort-based cost estimation model is proposed, implementing EEE to predict task’s effort along with natural language processing (NLP) analysis on task’s textual description to assign effort-based cost. TopCoder is selected as targeted CSSD platform, and the proposed scheme is implemented on TopCoder QA category comprising software testing tasks. Ensemble prediction is incorporated via random forest, support vector machine and neural network as base learners. LDA topic modeling is utilized for NLP analysis on the textual aspects of CSSD task, with a specific emphasis on the testing and technology factors. Effort estimation results confirm that EEE models, particularly stacking and weighted ensemble, surpass their base learners with 50% overall increased accuracy. Moreover, R ^2, log-likelihood and topic quality measures confirm considerable LDA model significance. Findings confirmed that cost adjustment achieved from EEE and NLP defines acceptable price range, covering major testing aspects."

Achieving organizational goals through power transmission is a significant concern for any organization, especially in India. The study proposes a project management framework for power transmission projects based on project critical success factors. Power Transmission projects are often influenced by numerous critical success factors which support the organization to reach its intended goals with high efficiency. A total of 46 critical success factors are considered of strategy, risk, contract, information technology, and stakeholder. The survey questionnaire is used as a research tool with professionals of power transmission projects from 14 private and public companies in India, who actively engage in the projects at different levels. The outcome of statistical analysis by SPSS-25 reveals that Project success has a positive direct relation with strategy, risk, information technology, stakeholder and whereas, a contract has not directed relation. As mediator variable risk, contract, information technology, and stakeholder have a direct relation with strategy. So, the contract has a significant indirect relation with project success. The proposed framework will support the alignment of project success with organizational goals through identified Critical Success Factors."

The authors discovered that there is a deficiency in effective risk mitigation monitoring in software project development when compared to the number of recommended alternatives. The results of this study, which looked at immune system activity and existing risk mitigation approaches, are crucial in assisting firms with enhancing their risk mitigation processes. The limitations of research, as well as potential future possibilities in these areas, are highlighted. In this study, we examined the process of the biological immune system artificially built to propose an efficient risk mitigation monitoring system. The relationship between BIS and risk management appears to be symbiotic. The primary aim is to incorporate learning and adaptation strategies to surmount personal constraints and attain mutually reinforcing outcomes by combining various techniques.

Inaccurate estimation of development efforts leads to significant financial losses and delays in the software project’s completion. Due to dynamic requirements, technological evolution, inadequate historical data, human factors, and project complexity, the developed models cannot achieve satisfactory accuracy. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a technique that uses data from previous projects to estimate the effort of the new project by identifying and adapting solutions that were successful in similar contexts. However, the effectiveness of CBR depends on tuning its multiple parameters, such as how past similar projects are retrieved, reused, adapted, and retained. In this paper, the Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) is used to identify the best combination of traditional CBR parameters (feature selection, similarity measures, and the k-value count of closest neighbors, feature weighting) to accurately estimate the development effort. This paper uses the HSA to optimize the parameters for CBR, enhancing the accuracy of the estimation. The proposed CBR-HSA approach is validated using thirteen public datasets from the PROMISE repository, NASA, SEERA, and a subset of the ISBSG dataset. It is evaluated using six reliable evaluation metrics. The results obtained are promising, particularly in accuracy, statistical significance, and computational time compared to some existing models."

Hospitals handle sensitive information that targets cybercriminals, and serious incidents have been reported worldwide and in Latin America. To improve this situation, it is proposed to implement a security event management system (SIEM) with automated alerts to strengthen cybersecurity and optimize the response to healthcare threats. The PPDIOO methodology was applied and consists of six phases: prepare, plan, design, implement, operate, and optimize. The methodology is adaptable to different projects and encourages continuous improvement, making it ideal for IT project management. The results demonstrate significant improvement in the detection and response to security incidents. The improvement in system operational efficiency ranged from 50% to 80%. In addition, the reduction from 4 to 2 h demonstrates that the system provides faster and more efficient response. In terms of security, it reflects a preventive improvement in network security, which decreases the risk from 25.53% to 0.05. Finally, it is concluded that SIEM with alert automation is an effective tool to strengthen cybersecurity in the healthcare sector, achieving early detection of threats with an accuracy rate of 90% and a reduction in response time of 45%.

It enables project managers to organize and manage project quality, cost, resources, and timelines. However, standard techniques for estimating development effort struggle due to the increased complexity, dynamic requirements, multifaceted nature, non-linear relationship, and greater interdependencies of modern software. Various machine learning models have been created periodically to tackle the deficiencies of standard estimation techniques. Nevertheless, the deployment is limited due to inefficient model-constructing approaches and inconclusive results. By meticulously optimizing preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning steps, this research presents a Diverse Bagging Effort ESTimation (DBEEST) model for more reliable and accurate software development effort estimation. To accomplish this, six homogeneous ensembles through bagging were applied to the USP05-FT and SEERA datasets. Subsequently, the predictions of each homogeneous ensemble were combined through averaging to generate a more reliable and accurate prediction with improved robustness against inconsistencies and errors. The results demonstrate the DBEEST model outperformed all individual bagging ensembles and produced consistent results by delivering an overall average of low Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Magnitude Relative Error values and an overall average of high Coefficient of determination values across both diverse datasets. Moreover, the proposed model can improve efficiency in handling software development projects, resource optimization, facilitating informed decision-making, and on-time project completion."

Uncertainty is inevitable in software development, which further complicates the scheduling of projects. We investigate the software project scheduling problem with uncertain activity durations (SPSP-UAD) and aim at obtaining effective scheduling policies for the problem. We present and transform a scenario-based non-linear chance-constrained stochastic programming model into an equivalent linear programming model. To solve the NP-hard SPSP-UAD efficiently, we develop a hybrid meta-heuristic TLBO-GA that combines the teaching–learning-based optimization algorithm (TLBO) and the genetic algorithm (GA). Our TLBO-GA is also equipped with some problem-specific operators, such as population initialization, rows exchange and local search. We use simulation to evaluate the scheduling policies obtained by our algorithms. Extensive computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our TLBO-GA in comparison to the exact solver CPLEX and four existing meta-heuristic algorithms. The comparative results reveal the effectiveness and efficiency of our TLBO-GA. Our TLBO-GA provides an extensible and adaptive automated scheduling decision support tool for the software project manager in the complex and uncertain software development environment."

Many researchers have pitched the argument in different dimensions to explain what they deem IT project success. By reviewing 46 studies based on the PSALAR framework, this study synthesizes the relationship between IT project success and its antecedents. Notably, we examine definitions of IT project success; hindrances to IT project success; and categorize IT project success based on their levels of origin using the Antecedents, Decision, Outcomes and Theories, Context, Methods frameworks."
Exploring Academic Conference Event Design Through Action Research,HCI International 2025 Posters,,,,10.1007/978-3-031-94156-6_28,Tsai-Hsuan ChengTz-Ying Lin,2025,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-94156-6_28,Conference paper,"Academic conferences are key scholarly events where experts, scholars, and stakeholders gather to present, discuss research findings, and engage in intellectual exchange, with the aims of education, issue exploration, and achieving other significant objectives. These conferences not only cultivate high-level talents in public speaking and communication skills but also foster the establishment of professional networks that encourage knowledge sharing and learning. In recent years, the landscape of domestic academic conferences in Taiwan has become increasingly diverse, featuring a variety of themes and emerging trends. However, most of the conference organizing methods tend to exhibit high homogeneity, with a limited range of organizational approaches. Therefore, this research adopts a three-stage study to explore the optimal process for academic conference design from the perspectives of participants, organizers, and experts. In the first stage, “Preliminary Investigation and Analysis,” this research conducted in-depth interviews with recent conference participants from the past three years, focusing on their experiences and impressions. Using a customer journey map, a “Submitter Journey Map” was developed to collect key information on academic conference participation, as well as insights into the tools and systems provided for submissions. This process helped consolidate submitters’ expectations for academic conferences. In the second stage, “Mid-term Action Research Implementation,” this study participated in the organization of a prominent academic conference, assisting with the construction of the conference’s official website and managing its social media presence. After the event, a quantitative analysis of the website’s user experience was conducted to further understand participants’ feedback on the submission system. Additionally, in-depth interviews were held with stakeholders to gather feedback and insights into their past experiences with large international conferences, laying the groundwork for constructing an action research reflection and developing a preliminary framework for conference design execution. In the third stage, “Post-Event Expert Consultation,” three experts with extensive experience in organizing and participating in large-scale international conferences were interviewed. Their insights were used to refine the “Academic Conference Design Process” and strengthen the practical application of the “Guidelines for Conference Activity Design Execution.“ The findings of this research are divided into two major parts. The first part includes the “Submitter Journey Map” and “Guidelines for Academic Conference Participation,” which provide valuable reference material for prospective conference submitters, enabling them to grasp participation methods, procedures, and important considerations. The second part consists of the “Conference Design Execution Process,” “49 Guidelines for Conference Design,” and “Checklist for Conference Services,” which offer a comprehensive reference for conference organizers to ensure the successful execution of conference designs. Moreover, the research provides a “Conference Website Content Structure Checklist,” aimed at helping organizing teams build tailored submission systems that optimize the submission process and improve the overall user experience, enhancing operational efficiency for both submitters and organizers. It is hoped that the results of this research will inspire more diverse and distinctive conference designs through the application of event design thinking, maximizing the impact of academic conferences."

Collaboration between small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) enables business partners to share equipment, labour, and skill-sets to fulfil larger projects in Partner Network (PN). We define PN as a group of companies that work together to enhance the capabilities of each other. The start of a new project triggers the establishment of a Virtual Organisation (VO). In this research paper, we present the framework for Collaborative Project Management in VO that includes the following collaboration-process steps: project initiation, project-plan preparation, searching for a subcontractor, preparation of quotations, evaluation of PN proposals, project-proposal formations, PN-agreement elaboration, and project management. In the current paper, the authors suggest using the novel five level modeling approach for Collaborative Business Process (CBP) modeling. Authors are using the Value-Added Chain (VAC) and Event Process Chain (EPC) notations to design the CBP in the ARIS architect software that enables to visualize the inputs, outputs and relationships between high level and low-level business processes. Project management in a VO is more sustainable then in conventional supply chains due to the common tools that enable the measurement of project success in a unified way with the possibility of responding quickly to changed conditions."

Several soft computing approaches have been proposed to increase estimation accuracy, and optimization techniques are utilized to concentrate on key aspects. However, a majority of works use data processing that has been found to be unreliable, time-consuming and typically leads to greater error rates. Therefore, the research proposes an efficient software development effort prediction model employing unique deep learning technology to alleviate the existing limitations. Data collection, pre-processing, feature selection and software development effort prediction are only a few of the varied phases of the proposed objective. After data collection, the data are pre-processed, including data cleaning, normalization, missing values and imputation. The expanded archer fish optimization method (Ext_AFO) is used to choose the best features from the pre-processed data. The Multilayer Perceptron Assisted Honey Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Feed Forward Network (Multi-HBiG) is built into this research work to provide an intelligent prediction model for software development effort estimation. The model parameters are adjusted using the Adaptive Honey Badger Optimisation Algorithm (A-Hba) to improve the overall estimation performance. The Albrecht dataset, China dataset, Desharnais dataset, Kemerer dataset, Maxwell dataset, Kitchenham dataset and Cocomos81 dataset are the datasets used in this study. The proposed approach surpassed other models when compared against Mean Relative Error (MRE), Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE), Mean Balanced Relative Error (MBRE) and Mean Inverted Balanced Relative Error (MIBRE) in the results section. The proposed model was assessed in this study using the MAE in each dataset, and it achieved 0.0753 for the China dataset, 0.0763 for the Cocomos81 dataset, 0.0737 for the Desharnais dataset, 0.0754 for the Kemerer dataset, 0.0759 for the Kitchenham dataset, 0.0734 for the Maxwell dataset and 0.0737 for the Albrecht dataset, respectively."

Startups play an increasingly dominant role in the economy through empowering risk-taking and innovative entrepreneurial behaviour. Collaboration with startups in product development leads to particular management challenges. While the automotive industry is sensitive to quality and requires controlled procedures, startups’ risk-taking behaviour can be hazardous in the entire supply chain. Furthermore, the expectations and opportunities of startups and usual firms are different, resulting in conflicts and risks in the product development process. The study investigates the evolution of the automotive supply chain focusing on enhancing the relevance of startups and highlighting critical factors and risks of the transition. The literature on automotive product development raises the consideration of risk management. The paper applied this knowledge base to startups.

Despite efforts to promote gender equality, deep-rooted biases and stereotypes continue to restrict women’s participation and advancement, especially in entrepreneurial and leadership roles. The HerTechVenture project aims to address these disparities by fostering inclusive environments in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), equipping female students with the confidence and skills needed for tech-driven entrepreneurship, and ultimately creating a new generation of female tech innovators and entrepreneurs. This work introduces the HerTechVenture project’s strategies and anticipated outcomes in promoting gender inclusivity in STEM education and entrepreneurship. The project employs a multifaceted approach, including needs assessments, targeted training programs, mentorship opportunities, and awareness campaigns. These activities aim to boost the confidence and competence of female students, enhance their entrepreneurial skills through practical training, and establish supportive networks. Furthermore, the project equips educators with tools to foster inclusive learning environments. While the HerTechVenture project marks a substantial step towards closing the gender gap in the tech entrepreneurial sector, future efforts should focus on assessing the long-term impact of these interventions and continuously developing innovative strategies to promote gender equality in STEM."
Applicability of Traditional Project Closeout Approaches in Agile Developed IT Projects,"Advances in Design, Simulation and Manufacturing IV",,,,10.1007/978-3-030-77719-7_25,Philipp RosenbergerJozsef Tick,2021,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77719-7_25,Conference paper,"This article investigates the applicability and compatibility of project closeout processes defined in traditional project management frameworks in cases of agile-developed IT projects. Based on a literature review analysis of three project management frameworks, the hypothesis is formed that traditional project closeout processes are critical in agile developed IT projects. The developed hypothesis suggests an unclear indication of how to trigger a project closeout, the inapplicability of scope fulfillment for closeout trigger, and critical transitions between closed projects and ongoing agile software improvement and maintenance. All three parts of the hypothesis are then individually evaluated by an online survey with 85 participants. As a result of this survey, all three hypotheses are falsified. For most project management practitioners in agile projects, closeout processes are not critical, scope fulfillment is still the most relevant closeout trigger, and the transition to a continues-improvement and maintenance process is seen as principally uncritical."

The study evaluates primary models including Waterfall, Agile, V-Model, Spiral, Prototype, Iterative and Incremental Model and Rapid Application Development Model, examining them across key factors including flexibility, project scale, development duration, cost, and software quality. Each model’s advantages and limitations are discussed, along with the specific project contexts in which they are most effective. Given the central role of the SDLC in software engineering, selecting an appropriate development model is critical for aligning with project requirements and constraints. Based on a study using quantitative approach, the findings indicate that Agile methodology outperforms other models due to its adaptability, iterative nature, and stakeholder involvement, leading to improved project efficiency and higher success rates. The paper concludes that the Agile methodology is the most effective approach for modern software development."
Inferring test models from user bug reports using multi-objective search,Empirical Software Engineering,,,,10.1007/s10664-023-10333-8,Giovani GuizzoFrancesco CalifanoFederica SarroFilomena FerrucciMark Harman,2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-023-10333-8,Article,"Bug reports are used by software testers to identify abnormal software behaviour. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary approach to automatically generate finite state machines (FSMs) based on bug reports written in natural language, to automatically capture incorrect software behaviour. These FSMs can then be used by testers to both exercise the reported bugs and create tests that can potentially reveal new bugs. The FSM generation is guided by a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) that simultaneously minimises three objectives: size of the models, number of unrealistic states (over-generalisation), and number of states not covered by the models (under-generalisation). We assess the feasibility of our approach for 10 real-world software programs by exploiting three different MOEAs (NSGA-II, NSGA-III and MOEA/D) and benchmarking them with the baseline tool KLFA. Our results show that KLFA is not practical to be used with real-world software, because it generates models that over generalise software behaviour. Among the three MOEAs, NSGA-II obtained significantly better results than the other two for all 10 programs, detecting a greater number of bugs for 90% of the programs. We also studied the differences in quality and model performance when MOEAs are guided by only two objectives rather than three during the evolution. We found that the use of under-approximation (or over-approximation) and size as objectives generates infeasible solutions. On the other hand, using as objectives over-approximation and under-approximation generates feasible solutions yet still worse than those obtained using all three objectives for 100% of the cases. The size objective acts as a diversity factor. As a consequence, an algorithm guided by all three objectives avoids local optima, controls the size of the models, and makes the results more diverse and closer to the optimal Pareto set."

Leveraging the principles of quantum physics, quantum computing has emerged as a new computational paradigm that offers significant advantages over classical computing. As quantum computing progresses rapidly, its potential applications across various fields are becoming apparent. In software engineering, many tasks involve complex computations where quantum computers can greatly speed up the development process, leading to faster and more efficient solutions. With the growing use of quantum-based applications in different fields, Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) has emerged as a discipline focused on designing, developing, and optimizing quantum software for diverse applications. This paper aims to review the role of quantum computing in software engineering research and the latest developments in QSE. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on this topic. We begin by introducing quantum computing, exploring its fundamental concepts, and discussing its potential applications in software engineering. We also examine various QSE techniques that expedite software development. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in quantum-driven software engineering and QSE. Our study reveals that quantum machine learning and quantum optimization have substantial potential to address classical software engineering tasks, though this area is still limited. Current QSE tools and techniques lack robustness and maturity, indicating a need for more focus. One of the main challenges is that quantum computing has yet to reach its full potential."

There are some algorithmic and non-algorithmic techniques are already developed to tackle the challenges of estimation tools in software project management such as Bayes probability-based approach, classification and regression, semantic analysis of software requirements, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, and hybrid methods. These techniques are unable to satisfy the management of modern and dynamic software development process. The aim of this paper is to propose a method of estimation by using the fuzzy logic’s related functions and the fuzzy algorithm of the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model to improve the accuracy of Functional Point Analysis (FPA) to estimate the cost and effort of software development. A tool called ALBRE is also developed to support the calculation of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method based on the ANFIS model produces positive results, with less errors. The accuracy of VAF increases by up to 80% compared to the method proposed by Albrecht in Function Point Counting Practices Manual 4.2.1 by considering the Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE)."

Software engineering is concerned with the application of software systems to various system processes. Agile is a method of software development that emphasizes flexibility before its needed and pragmatic methods for delivering a final product. Agile software development requires a change in the way many organizations do things because it focuses on clean delivery of individual software parts instead of whole solution. Agile is an iterative approach to the management of projects as well as development of software. It makes it possible for teams to give value to customers more rapidly and with fewer complications than is possible with old methods. A “big bang” release is something an agile team strives to steer clear of in favor of smaller, more manageable components of work. First, deliver a quick introduction to the agile software development concepts.

With major corporations and academic institutions investing in quantum hardware and software, there has been a rise in the development of quantum-enabled systems, particularly within open-source communities. However, despite the promising nature of quantum technologies, these communities face critical socio-technical challenges, including the emergence of socio-technical anti-patterns known as community smells. These anti-patterns, prevalent in open-source environments, have the potential to negatively impact both product quality and community health by introducing technical debt and amplifying architectural and code smells. Despite the importance of these socio-technical factors, there remains a scarcity of research investigating their influence within quantum open-source communities. This work aims to address this gap by providing a first step in analyzing the socio-technical well-being of quantum communities through a cross-sectional study. By understanding the socio-technical dynamics at play, it is expected that foundational knowledge can be established to mitigate the risks associated with community smells and ensure the long-term sustainability of open-source quantum initiatives."

They provide instantaneous data access, continuous communication and the means to make educated decisions, which solves the majority of the problems that used to be like a stubborn tagalong to project management. The current research deciphers the significance of MIS in cloud nature in upgrading governance and thereby extending scalable and flexible benefits of designing mechanism that fits the changing demands of IT projects. The study uses a detailed examination of case studies and survey data to show how these systems rationalize activities like risk management, resource management and performance review. The results indicate substantial gains in project transparency, accountability and stakeholder participation. In particular, cloud-based MIS promotes collaboration among the remote team members with data stored in a centralized location and with simple tools for communication and task sharing. This breaks down silos, improves focus toward departmental and organizational goals, and keeps projects on time and within budget. Additionally, it helps to demonstrate the importance of cloud-based MIS for predictive risk management, contributing to the creation of resilient and adaptive governance models. Firms using these systems indicated that they experienced increased success with projects, more efficient use of resources, and greater satisfaction among stakeholders. The paper also highlights the strategic relevance of the use of cloud MIS for IT project governance and provides recommendations in terms of practical implementation of potential benefits. Integrated well, they enable organizations to realize better project results, to drive innovation, and to remain competitive in a more digital world."

Despite this, 2020 saw numerous news stories break related to ethically questionable uses of AI. In part, this is because AI ethics theory remains highly abstract, and of limited practical applicability to those actually responsible for designing algorithms and AI systems. Our previous research sought to start closing this gap between the ‘what’ and the ‘how’ of AI ethics through the creation of a searchable typology of tools and methods designed to translate between the five most common AI ethics principles and implementable design practices. Whilst a useful starting point, that research rested on the assumption that all AI practitioners are aware of the ethical implications of AI, understand their importance, and are actively seeking to respond to them. In reality, it is unclear whether this is the case. It is this limitation that we seek to overcome here by conducting a mixed-methods qualitative analysis to answer the following four questions: what do AI practitioners understand about the need to translate ethical principles into practice? What motivates AI practitioners to embed ethical principles into design practices? What barriers do AI practitioners face when attempting to translate ethical principles into practice? And finally, what assistance do AI practitioners want and need when translating ethical principles into practice?"

To overcome these challenges, the provision of feedback has led to excellent results, such as less procrastination and improved academic performance. Yet, current feedback artifacts neglect learners’ heterogeneity when it comes to prescriptive feedback that should meet personal characteristics and self-regulated learning skills. In this paper, we derive requirements from self-regulated learning theory for a feedback artifact that takes learners’ heterogeneity into account. Based on these requirements, we design, instantiate, and evaluate an Explainable AI-based approach. The results demonstrate that our artifact is able to detect promising patterns in data on learners’ behaviors and characteristics. Moreover, our evaluation suggests that learners perceive our feedback as valuable. Ultimately, our study informs Information Systems research in the design of future Explainable AI-based feedback artifacts that seek to address learners’ heterogeneity."

We provide a catalog of prompt examples tailored for 12 key knowledge areas of software engineering. These prompts can be used to generate code, tests, explanations and more, enabling students to experiment and get personalized guidance. Students can brainstorm requirements, simulate APIs, get automated feedback, and much more. Using ChatGPT and similar AI systems prepares students for tools they may encounter in industry and gives them valuable experience in human-AI collaboration. While generative AI offers many benefits, it also brings challenges that must be addressed. We discuss concerns around the correctness, risks and quality of AI-generated answers.

Despite being a major contributor to job creation and offering a high wage package that benefits the national economy as a whole, the IT sector struggles to retain employees for long periods of time. The purpose of the study is to look at the numerous aspects that influence employee attrition and may be responsible for retention concerns. This study provides a detailed analysis of employee attrition in the IT industry, highlighting key factors such as job dissatisfaction, career stagnation, and organizational culture. The study employs comprehensive methodologies and presents actionable strategies for retention, including employee engagement and skill development. It is a valuable resource for understanding and mitigating attrition challenges. To preserve the goal of controlling hazards associated with humans, they must be detected during the SDLC in order for IT sectors to remain viable and productive. The industry most significantly impacted by employee attrition is information technology, which is dominated by knowledge workers and is rapidly increasing. These information workers establish high expectations for themselves and their lives, distinguishing them from workers in other fields. The study found that, in addition to other aspects that employees examine before leaving an organization, assessment, training, transparency, and flexibility are important characteristics. Human-related risks in software development can be mitigated, avoided, or transferred by implementing appropriate strategies and procedures. The attrition rate is an important HR statistic that helps firms assess the stability and happiness of their workforce. It also highlights potential areas for improvement in workforce planning, people management, and engagement, indicating the effectiveness of retention strategies."

This is due to the recent open-source XZ utils and PyPI projects based attacks where the attackers employed similar strategies. A backdoor was injected in the libraries developed by these projects for future exploitation when software users installed them on systems. These attacks were executed by the trusted developers of these projects and influenced by unknown promoters. Therefore, there is a need to scrutinize Open Source Software (OSS) Security to protect the legacy of Open Software development for the future. This paper provides an overview of these two attack strategies through their case studies, which aid in the creation of a generic attack framework for supply chain attacks on OSS. We present the existing detection methods for OSS security in this work and their lacunas taking into account at various stages of a supply chain attack. This makes it necessary to build platforms that allow the current OSS security detection modules to be utilized in sequence. Therefore, we introduce an OSS security Detection platform that does not completely address the limitations of the detection technique, but when combined, they can maximize the effectiveness of an OSS security quality check."
Requirements Engineering (RE) in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Systems Implementation: The Need to Emphasize Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) for Ethical AI,Artificial Intelligence Research,,,,10.1007/978-3-031-78255-8_25,Eddie Liywalii,2025,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-78255-8_25,Conference paper,"In traditional approaches to develop software systems that do not have an Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) component, requirements determination activities – also called Requirements Engineering (RE) – are well-established and researched. When it comes to building software systems with one or more AI/ML components, the process is dependent heavily on data with limited or in some cases no insight into the non-functional requirements of the system’s internal workings such as fairness, accountability and transparency, inter alia. In this paper, I review literature to probe how an emphasis on non-functional requirements during requirements determination can help address ethical requirements when implementing AI systems. The results show that currently technical experts often emphasize functional requirements more than non-functional requirements. Where they do, the emphasis is still on system-oriented non-functional requirements such as portability, maintainability, opacity, inter alia. However, AI being an interdisciplinary subject, encompassed in a bracket of sociotechnical systems, there is need to revisit this tendency by technical experts. I propose a framework for classifying ethical requirements under non-functional requirements in order to ensure equal emphasis on environment-oriented non-functional requirements such as privacy, fairness, eco-friendly among others. I also argue that the use of a value sensitive design (VSD) approach will help in the implementation of ethical AI systems in order to address ethical concerns from stakeholders. In addition, existing technical literature has focused more on using AI to manage RE activities (AI in RE), yet very limited research has been done on RE for AI systems (RE4AI). Requirements engineering is generally accepted as the most critical and complex process within the development of sociotechnical systems. The literature also confirms that during requirements determination for AI systems (RE4AI), an emphasis on non-functional requirements could actually help address some ethical issues that are raised by stakeholders."
Towards a Methodological Approach for Intelligent IS/IT Project Portfolio Dashboard,Digital Technologies and Applications,,,,10.1007/978-3-031-68653-5_32,Anass ZaidouniMohammed Abdou Janati IdrissiAdil Bellabdaoui,2024,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-68653-5_32,Conference paper,"With the advent of digital transformation, organizations have become more aware of sustaining and valuing their Portfolio of Information System (IS) and Information Technology (IT) initiatives in pursuit of strategic objectives. Thus, the IS/IT Project Management Office (PMO) should be equipped with IS/IT Project Portfolio Dashboards, to monitor the up-to-date performance of the IS/IT Project Portfolio and consequently carry out appropriate actions. Nevertheless, this performance is often compromised by uncertainty. In this paper, a methodological approach for intelligent IS/IT Project Portfolio Dashboard is designed based on three Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which are Strategic Portfolio Value ( $$SPV$$ SPV ), IS/IT Project Portfolio ranking, and Overall Portfolio Risk ( $$OPR$$ OPR ). The proposed methodological approach measures the two first KPIs taking into consideration uncertainty to model respectively variability of strategic objectives in $$SPV$$ SPV and subjectivity of IS/IT PMO experts in IS/IT Project Portfolio ranking. Besides strategic interpretability, as an IS/IT PMO experts’ knowledge, is incorporated in $$OPR$$ OPR . An IS/IT PMO Project Portfolio case study demonstrates the new methodological approach applicability in which the $$SPV$$ SPV equals 0.68, the computed ranking emphasizes two highly-priority scored IS/IT projects while ensuring decision-making reliability via a Consistency Ratio ( $$CR$$ CR ) lower than 0.1, and the predicted $$OPR$$ OPR is obtained with a satisfactory Root Mean Square Error ( $$RMSE$$ RMSE ) accuracy of 0.108. The new methodological approach advances the current body of knowledge on IS/IT Project Portfolio performance measurement under uncertainty forms and enables IS/IT PMOs to support data-driven decision-making and consequently carry out managerial actions appropriately."

Once with I4.0 and worldwide digitalization, the global software development industry becomes a very significant and dynamic pillar in the contemporary environment. It is more and more evident that almost all devices and machines in our lives become interconnected and more intelligent (software-driven). From ordinary smartphones to complex, innovative airplanes, the automotive industry is part of global digitalization. The software development industry evolution has two essential characteristics: agility and speed. These aspects have a real impact in all other industries, including software development, practically in any product or process development. In the last 30 years, automotive development started to focus significantly on vehicle’s “brain” capabilities. In the automotive world, automation and controls represented the forerunner of the software development industry, but today, logic and the car’s computers started to work with artificial intelligence. The complexity and the development dimensions are many times increased, and the industry took significant steps forward. The safety aspects of the vehicle are crucial for the entire product development. For this reason, the industry has many regulations and standards that ensure the product’s quality and safety. Therefore, in automotive, the software development is not aligned with the general software development from the speed and agility point of view and the paper shows a possible harmonization of the methodology in automotive software Project development through a hybrid solution."

Under MDR, software and information systems may be considered as medical devices. Behaviour Change Support Systems (BCSS) are information and communication technologies aimed at helping their users to achieve behaviour change targets. Designers, developers, and researchers of health BCSS (hBCSS) need to understand the impact of this new regulation on the development of such systems as the regulation influences both design and development in a variety of ways. Furthermore, myriads of health BCSS have been developed previously in the medical, fitness, and wellbeing domains, and a substantial number of them may require qualification, classification, or reclassification as medical devices under the new regulation. However, the regulation process is complex and requires knowledge and expertise which many manufacturers do not have in-house. Depending on the context and classification, the costs may suddenly ramp up and become too much for smaller developers, and thus they should be carefully assessed. In this paper, we discuss the regulation from the point of view of hBCSS developers. We look at the regulatory process and highlight key issues for developers of hBCSS. Particular attention is given to the classification and design requirements most likely to pose immediate challenges to developers. In addition, we discuss the costs associated with MDR which are difficult to estimate without previous experience."

Under conditions of environment’s increased functioning entropy caused by crises or military conflicts, the importance of IT industry’s stable functioning can’t be overstated. This paper considers the possibility of fuzzy decision support systems (DSS) efficient usage to forecast and predict the dynamics of IT industry functioning at a scope of a single country, using Ukraine’s IT industry as an example. The software platform used for demonstration purposes is the authentically designed fuzzy DSS FuzzyKIDE. The mathematical basis of platform’s functioning is fuzzy logic, which makes it possible to take into account the influences of a set of factors of different nature and obtain a reasonable assessment with potentially inaccurate information. The structure of DSS is offered, using a combined model of the semantic network and fuzzy implication rules. Fuzzy rules are based on predetermined relationships between key influence factors, the analysis of which is offered as well. The use of the DSS is aimed at forming a holistic forecast of IT industry development. The operation of the DSS is demonstrated on the example of Ukraine’s IT industry functioning in different points in time. Comparing the conclusions of the DSS with the historical statistical data of Ukraine’s IT industry functioning proves the feasibility of fuzzy DSS usage."

An Analysis of Adversarial/Cooperative Attitudes in Construction Contracting: How Approaches to Adversarial Procurement Might Have a Lasting Effect on Project Culture,"Climate Emergency – Managing, Building , and Delivering the Sustainable Development Goals",,,,10.1007/978-3-030-79450-7_21,Emily HarrisonJohn Heathcote,2022,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-79450-7_21,Conference paper,"Bidding competitively, and based on price, is a feature of projects in the engineering construction sectors. UK white papers, and literature, have questioned this practice and its impact on overall project efficiency. Recommendations for more collaborative approaches between client and supplier, adopting approaches more typical in other sectors, have been made, but not wholeheartedly adopted. UK construction engineering is heavily invested in a competitive bidding approach, and literature charts its reluctance to fully commit or adopt more partnering approaches. In UK construction, the professions also include the ‘Quantity Surveyor’ profession, relatively unique to the UK. This profession addresses itself to the preparation of cost estimates and the bidding and contract price negotiations before, during and post project. Consequently, Quantity Surveyors are well placed to manage projects and are frequently called on to do so, and this group often progresses their careers as project managers. This research speculated whether a working environment of adversarial contracting practice might influence professional attitudes towards a more conflict-orientated approach to projects. The study tested this hypothesis using the ‘prisoner’s dilemma’ game, to create an experimental basis against which to compare whether a sample of ‘Quantity Surveyors’ would adopt more un-cooperative strategies towards the game, when compared to a control group of people recruited from society in general. The study found that the sample of professionals adopted more competitive/adversarial (and less collaborative) strategies towards the game than the control group. This finding might have implications for practice, as the study inferred that the competitive procurement environment they worked in turned professionals away from the consideration of more partnering approaches. Much attention is given to cooperative approaches, such as partnering, when proposing project solutions to creating conditions for generating more sustainable project outcomes. The findings may help understand why the repeated recommendations for more collaborative partnering approaches to contacting remain untypical in construction engineering."

This model, considering regional characteristics and spatial relationships, allows for a comprehensive understanding of the geographical distribution of interest in STEM fields and the gender disparities within. Analyses at both global and local levels were conducted to test for the presence of spatial patterns. The impact of social and economic factors on gender-specific enrollment rates in STEM fields was assessed using Ordinary Least Squares analysis, without accounting for spatial autocorrelation. The dataset, based on provincial social and economic indicators for the year 2022, revealed that both women and men in the provinces exhibit similar tendencies towards settling in STEM fields. The preference for STEM fields is lower in the eastern regions, while more pronounced in coastal and industrialized cities. The findings indicate a positive correlation with per capita gross domestic product, the number of teachers in higher education institutes, central government budget expenditure, and the population ratio in the province."
Integrating and optimizing quality and client satisfaction in resource constrained time-cost trade-off for construction projects with NSGA-III methodology,Asian Journal of Civil Engineering,,,,10.1007/s42107-024-01137-2,Ankit ShrivastavaMukesh Pandey,2024,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42107-024-01137-2,Article,"This study investigates the integration of quality and client satisfaction into resource-constrained time-cost trade-off optimization for construction projects. Utilizing the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), a multi-objective trade-off model (MOTM) is developed to optimize the resource-constrained time-cost-quality-client satisfaction trade-off (RCTCQCST). Through a case study of a one-storey building construction project involving 21 activities with five execution modes each, the model’s effectiveness is demonstrated. The case study results yield Pareto-optimal combinations of execution modes, ensuring resource-efficient project execution, and demonstrate the NSGA-III-based MOTM’s effectiveness in balancing objectives under resource constraints. Besides, a weighted sum technique is employed to pick one solution from Pareto-optimal solutions for the execution of project. Comparative analysis against existing scheduling models shows that the NSGA-III-based MOTM performs better in achieving optimal trade-offs. The implications of this study suggest that incorporating quality and client satisfaction into the optimization process can significantly enhance project outcomes, offering a robust decision-making tool for project managers to achieve a comprehensive balance between time, cost, quality, and client satisfaction.

The industry’s operations, productivity, expenditures, and profit have all been impacted. With the present state of the economy, it’s natural that certain methods and frameworks are no longer as useful, efficient, or effective as they once were. This study examines the various relationships between delays, profit, productivity rate, and project acquisition, as well as their impact on the project-change management practices of companies in the Philippine construction industry, with the goal of developing a new project-change management framework that is flexible and adaptable to future changes. This research employs a variety of statistical techniques to ascertain the significance of each variable and its contribution to project change management. Through the use of artificial neural network modeling and causal loop diagramming, the different connections between the variables were graphically interpreted. The artificial neural network modeling of the variables demonstrated a high degree of accuracy, with a R all value of 0.99492; scatter plots also revealed a high degree of positive correlation. The causal loop diagram illustrates the many connections between the input variables and their contributing components. Together, the models and statistical tests summarize the criteria employed by the researchers to create a project-change management framework that is focused on its capacity to be used for both short- and long-term objectives, is applicable to the new normal, and is adaptable to any future change."

It scaffolds students’ learning in complex and sometimes overwhelming context-based learning environments. Effects of the implementation on both students’ learning outcomes and self-reported perceptions of six affective and metacognitive outcomes were investigated. Six teachers implemented Scrum methodology in a context-based secondary chemistry module on Green Chemistry. Their classes formed the experimental group. Based on how students experienced the quality of the implementation, teachers of the experimental group were subdivided into top-teachers and growth-teachers. Consequently, their students formed two sub-experimental groups. The comparison group, which did not use Scrum methodology, consisted of students taught by four teachers. A pre-test post-test control group design was used to study its effect on students’ achievements and self-reported affective and metacognitive outcomes. Students of both experimental groups outperformed students of the comparison group with a large effect-size (top-teachers); and medium effect-size (growth-teachers) on learning outcomes. Findings on students’ perceptions of affective and metacognitive outcomes revealed medium and small effects of Scrum methodology. Despite the fact that the implementation is challenging for teachers, it appears that Scrum methodology has positive effects on students’ achievement and on students’ perceptions of affective and metacognitive dimensions of their learning."

In the contemporary information technology era, software has become fundamental to human activity, highlighting the necessity for high-quality and reliable software. Minor bugs in software can lead to significant disasters, as illustrated by the failures of ARIANE-5 and the Mars Climate Orbiter, which were attributed to small errors with massive impacts. Traditional testing methods like Unit and Integration Testing often fall short in detecting low-frequency bugs, which can cause system crashes or other non-crashing errors. To address this, Random Testing has been introduced as an effective tool for identifying these elusive bugs. The paper proposes an enhancement to random testing through the generation of optimal test cases using the Object Behavior Dependence Model, aimed at reducing faults more efficiently. These test cases are processed through algorithms like Genetic Algorithm, Adaptive Genetic Algorithms, and Genetic Algorithms, with a focus on the Genetic Algorithm for minimizing illegal inputs and redundant test cases. This algorithm employs coverage metrics to evaluate test cases, refining the input space by integrating previous and current inputs. The utilization of optimal test cases generated through this method is expected to significantly enhance the performance and reliability of software applications."

Our work presented here addresses this gap by discussing how operationalisation of digital ethics can be achieved within this domain. The challenges and insights from the Analytics Center of Excellence at Merck KGaA, a multinational science and technology company, are utilised as a case study for implementing digital ethics within this domain. We present the development and deployment of Merck’s Digital Ethics Check (MDEC), an instrument tailored to address the ethical challenges in data analytics. The present work underscores the advantages of a semi-automated integration of digital ethics into data analytics. In doing so, we highlight the relevance of the challenges encountered in the practical application of digital ethics within the domain of data analytics in a business context. Our work provides a practical impetus to guide organisations seeking to embed ethical considerations within their data analytics operations."

Why Target Communities Remain Subjects Rather than Partners of Development Agencies in Integrated Conservation and Development Projects in Latin America,The European Journal of Development Research,,,,10.1057/s41287-024-00658-5,Louise Marie Busck-LumholtEsteve CorberaOle Mertz,2024,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41287-024-00658-5,Article,"A pesar de los repetidos llamados a Proyectos Integrados de Conservación y Desarrollo (en inglés, “Integrated Conservation and Development Projects”, ICDPs) localmente anclados, la autoridad de toma de decisiones de los Pueblos Indígenas y Comunidades Locales (en inglès, “Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities”, IPLCs) objetivo sigue siendo limitada. Este documento se basa en una perspectiva de Lógicas Institucionales para examinar el papel de las principales agencias de desarrollo—el Banco Mundial (BM), la Agencia de los Estados Unidos para el Desarrollo Internacional (USAID), el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID), y el Banco Alemán de Desarrollo (KfW)—en perpetuar este desafío. Las entrevistas con los gerentes de proyectos en la región de América Latina y el Caribe (ALC) revelan complejas jerarquías internas, enfoque en riesgos, alta presión de rendimiento, una lógica de ""mejor que nada"", y un enfoque de no intervención en la participación comunitaria. Sostenemos que estos problemas están arraigados en la estructura organizativa y en las mentalidades individuales que constituyen una lógica de gestión de proyectos, que a su vez plantea preocupaciones sobre la capacidad y la voluntad de las agencias de desarrollo para fomentar la propiedad local de los ICDPs. El documento pide a la comunidad internacional de donantes que reflexione y transforme dicha lógica de gestión, y que asigne un poder de toma de decisiones y recursos más sustanciales a los representantes locales.

Des entretiens avec des chefs de projet dans la région Amérique Latine et Caraïbes (ALC) révèlent des hiérarchies internes complexes, un focus sur le risque, une forte pression de performance, une logique de ""mieux que rien"", et une approche détachée de la participation communautaire. Nous soutenons que ces problèmes sont enracinés dans la structure organisationnelle et les mentalités individuelles qui constituent une logique de gestion de projet, qui à son tour soulève des préoccupations quant à la capacité et la volonté des agences de développement à favoriser l'appropriation locale des ICDPs. Le document appelle la communauté internationale des donateurs à réfléchir sur et à transformer une telle logique de gestion, et à attribuer plus de pouvoir décisionnel substantiel et de ressources aux représentants locaux. Despite repeated calls for locally anchored Integrated Conservation and Development Projects (ICDPs), the decision-making authority of targeted Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs) remains limited. This paper is grounded on an Institutional Logics perspective to examine the role of major development agencies—the World Bank (WB), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the German Development Bank (KfW)—in perpetuating this challenge. Interviews with project managers in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region reveal complex internal hierarchies, risk-focus, high performance pressure, a “better than nothing” rationale, and a hands-off approach to community participation. We argue that these tendencies are rooted in organisational structure and individual mentalities that constitute a project management logic, which in turn raises concerns about the ability and willingness of development agencies to foster local project ownership of ICDPs. The paper calls for the international donor community to reflect on and transform such management logic, and to allocate more substantial decision-making power and resources to local representatives."

Comparing to the normal projects, there is much more uncertainty in software projects. The software project urgently needs to strengthen the risk management, which mainly displays in the following two aspects: firstly, the risk management is the internal request in various project groups. As a result of the rapid development in software technology and the widespread application of software system in various social aspects, each kind of risk factors and the risk occurrence have greatly increased, and the loss scale that the risk event created has expanded. All these issues have proposed higher management requests for the project groups. Secondly, the unceasing improvement of risk management method and the successful application on many typical projects have attracted many software project groups to carry on their own risk management. Currently, the risk management has overcome the limitation of traditional methods that only adopt some single measure to deal with risks. While, the current risk management comprehensively utilizes each kind of control risk measures, and improve these methods day by day. However, in software development process, Risk Identification, Risk Assessment are the key elements assuring project success. This paper is designed to reconstruct the risk identification system of software projects from the perspective of nine fields of project management."

Keraia: A Knowledge Engineering and Reference AI Architecture,Proceedings of Ninth International Congress on Information and Communication Technology,,,,10.1007/978-981-97-3562-4_27,Stephen Richard VareyAlessandro Di StefanoThe Anh Han,2024,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-3562-4_27,Conference paper,"The original intent of artificial intelligence was unveiled at the Dartmouth AI Summer Research Project in 1956. During a 2-month study, it was conjectured that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence could in principle be so precisely described that a machine could be made to simulate it. The question asked then was how one could make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, and solve the kinds of problems now reserved for humans. The question remains relevant today. This paper presents a reference AI architecture, dubbed Keraia , a symbolic knowledge engineering platform that implements the original intent. The platform includes a repository that serves three purposes: (1) a repository for captured human expertise; (2) an execution platform where previous solutions to known problems can be reused and applied to exact or similar problems; and (3) a collaboration platform where a society of domain experts can create new solutions or modify previous solutions. In support of these objectives, four core features—a novel knowledge representation language, a reference architecture, a general-purpose paradigm builder and a knowledge engineering methodology were developed. The target is to provide domain experts with tools to model precisely how they see their world and how they solve problems. As a case study, we adopt an implementation of the risk board game. It requires expertise and, in these knowledge-rich environments, we introduce a practical knowledge acquisition process and a platform supporting that process."

To address this gap, we present a mixed-methods study based on 54 Danish government IT projects completed between 2011 and 2020. Using archival data and measures established by Flyvbjerg and colleagues, we find that cost and schedule overrun is substantially lower than reported in previous studies. Qualitative analysis based on interviews and documents in a purposefully selected sub-sample shows that projects are more likely to be completed within budget and schedule if managers actively adopt four key practices: building one team, accommodating uncertainty, rigorous project management and capitalizing on previous domain knowledge. Our findings also suggest that scope reductions may help projects complete within budget and schedule. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for IT project management."

The research purpose is to develop a methodology for configuring MSME management systems in conditions of turbulence. For 5 years, the authors conducted a deep interview with the owners and management of companies. We collected data on the tools used and methods of management theory, as well as about the problems that the owners of innovation-driven enterprises (IDE) face when building a management system in a turbulent environment. During the study, the authors relied on the case study methods and the grounded theory method forming the concept of configuring control systems. The results of the analysis of the collected data and the conclusions obtained by the authors are presented in the final section of this work. One of the limited resources for the founders of IDE companies is time, which affects the insufficient development of management theory by owners, who are most often managers of their business. This affects the quality of the control system they created, which does not withstand turbulence, does not meet the requirements of the flexibility and stability that are necessary for the regular development of innovations. The work presents an authors’ concept that develops the direction of configuration management, but focuses not on a static configuration, but on the methods of regular transformation of the management system, dynamic configuration."

This study delves into innovative project management strategies, emphasising the distinctiveness of IoT compared to traditional IT systems. The study proposes adopting the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) to orchestrate agile solutions in multi-team and enterprise-wide IoT projects. Rigorously assessing the practicality, the study leverages a hypothetical logistics project as a proving ground. In this dynamic model, three teams align with the four-layer reference architecture for IoT systems. The narrative unfolds by breaking the project into tangible program increments and features, assigned to teams, and refined into agile user stories. Embracing agile principles, the authors stress cross-team synchronisation, continual improvement, shared objectives, iterative planning, and delivering tangible customer value. The study illustrates how this solution ensures team synchronisation throughout diverse project phases. The authors have also highlighted how synchronisation shall be maintained across teams as they move through the various phases and iterations of the project. The proposed solution is populated with examples from a hypothetical logistics project to help visualise the solution. As the narrative concludes, the authors underscore the effectiveness of SAFe in the IoT realm, acknowledging unique challenges. The study provides actionable insights and outlines avenues for future research, leaving the practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of the intricate dance between IoT systems and agile frameworks."

This paper proposes a model to guide the appropriation of digital learning technologies in the Higher Education Institutes. To achieve it, initially, an exploration of the literature concerning the appropriation of digital technologies in the context of learning for higher education institutions was made, and then, data was collected that allowed us to understand the state of the appropriation of digital technologies for learning; Thus, a model with interrelated components for appropriate digital technologies for learning was designed. It included metrics that allow us to know the level of appropriation. Finally, the authors validated its relevance to digital technologies for learning projects among stakeholders through their strategic guidelines for appropriation in different academic contexts."

However, with the popularization of APM, new challenges emerge. This study identifies the barriers in APM implementation and obtains relative rankings for their importance using the input of industry experts and Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques. Following the thorough review of the literature and five individual interview sessions, a total of 13 barriers of APM were identified and categorized under 4 main themes (High-level Organizational, project planning, team operation, and Quality Management). The final weights of the 13 APM barriers were obtained with the application of a recently introduced MCDM technique called Best–Worst Method (BWM). The findings from this study reveal that the top five sub-barriers are in order of priority: the lack of adequate and accurate description of tasks, the unclear time requirements and project schedule, the lack of effective communication/knowledge sharing, the lack of clarity in team roles and task ownership and the lack of understanding of agile project management principles. This reflects the fact that barriers are spread out into a wide range of factors, highly dependent on the inherent features of APM as well as on human communication and social skills."

An enhanced multidimensional requirement oriented quality function deployment method for sustainable self service machine design,Scientific Reports,,,,10.1038/s41598-025-99732-z,Liang ZhuMohd Heikal Husin,2025,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-025-99732-z,Article,"Self-service machines provide round-the-clock access to various services, enhancing operational efficiency, reducing waiting times, and minimizing human errors. However, their design has traditionally prioritized business functionality and user experience, with minimal attention to sustainability principles. As finite resources and environmental concerns gain prominence, embedding sustainability into self-service machine design is crucial for promoting resource efficiency, environmental protection, and social responsibility. Current sustainable product design methods tend to focus on environmental features, often overlooking the multidimensional requirements necessary for a balanced approach. Addressing this gap, this study proposes an enhanced multidimensional requirement-oriented quality function deployment method, which uses multiple one-dimensional quality of houses to independently process requirements across different dimensions. This approach effectively reduces the complexity associated with traditional quality function deployment, enabling a more comprehensive and strategically aligned design process. By prioritizing key sustainability dimensions, this method offers a robust framework for developing sustainable self-service machines, aligning design outcomes with sustainability goals."

While there are many claims regarding the value of flow to control development activity, there is a lack of rigorous research on this topic. In this study, we use control theory as a lens to explore how flow tools and metrics are used to enact both formal and informal control modes. This qualitative study draws on a cross-case analysis of two multinationals located in Ireland that involved interviews with five software development teams distributed across Ireland, India, and the US. The findings reveal that both managers and project teams try to conduct business as usual in order to maintain their control status. This study contributes four key challenges on the use of flow tools, evidence-based recommendations on how to effectively implement flow, and a research agenda for future researchers. While the findings are within the context of flow-based software development projects, the lessons learned can be generalised to other software development contexts."
Developing a combined framework for priority setting in integrated health and social care systems,BMC Health Services Research,,,,10.1186/s12913-023-09866-x,Marissa CollinsMicaela MazzeiRachel BakerAlec MortonLucy FrithKeith SyrettPaul LeakCam Donaldson,2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12913-023-09866-x,Article,"Background There is an international move towards greater integration of health and social care to cope with the increasing demand on services.. In Scotland, legislation was passed in 2014 to integrate adult health and social care services resulting in the formation of 31 Health and Social Care Partnerships (HSCPs). Greater integration does not eliminate resource scarcity and the requirement to make (resource) allocation decisions to meet the needs of local populations. There are different perspectives on how to facilitate and improve priority setting in health and social care organisations with limited resources, but structured processes at the local level are still not widely implemented. This paper reports on work with new HSCPs in Scotland to develop a combined multi-disciplinary priority setting and resource allocation framework. Methods To develop the combined framework, a scoping review of the literature was conducted to determine the key principles and approaches to priority setting from economics, decision-analysis, ethics and law, and attempts to combine such approaches. Co-production of the combined framework involved a multi-disciplinary workshop including local, and national-level stakeholders and academics to discuss and gather their views. Results The key findings from the literature review and the stakeholder workshop were taken to produce a final combined framework for priority setting and resource allocation. This is underpinned by principles from economics (opportunity cost), decision science (good decisions), ethics (justice) and law (fair procedures). It outlines key stages in the priority setting process, including: framing the question, looking at current use of resources, defining options and criteria, evaluating options and criteria, and reviewing each stage. Each of these has further sub-stages and includes a focus on how the combined framework interacts with the consultation and involvement of patients, public and the wider staff. Conclusions The integration agenda for health and social care is an opportunity to develop and implement a combined framework for setting priorities and allocating resources fairly to meet the needs of the population. A key aim of both integration and the combined framework is to facilitate the shifting of resources from acute services to the community."

Risk is one of the key factors that influences the cost, dependability, reliability, and performance of software development. Risks are described as the unpredictability associated with upcoming events in the future. The study showed that the most challenging risks are in requirements, programme, technology, management, scheduling, quality, and budget. Without handling software risks properly, they become the riskiest, which can cause some good software to fail. Risk identification, risk management, and risk analysis should be done sensibly. For a very long time, in the development process of software, many researchers have focused on a variety of approaches and methods for reducing the vulnerability of risk analysis and management. In this research, a systematic literature review has been done to analyze the adverse impact of various risk identification and risk management tools and techniques, as well as risk analysis for software development. As a benchmark, we have reviewed various models in the context of risk management tools and techniques developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI). We've tried to determine the best or most appropriate tools and techniques for risk management in software development, based on the severity and various features of these models, and we have tried to show their shortcomings as well as their asset qualities. This paper gives a detailed comparison of different tools and methods for managing software-related risks, looking at some of the things they have in common."

There is an extensive set of approaches and tools for creating design artifacts. It is very important to use good practices to improve the quality of design artifacts and a development process of creating software systems. Modern software project repositories contain many software systems. However, there are no effective methods for information retrieval and analyzing existing projects to gain access to best practices. Thus, it is necessary to develop a model of a software system project, considering various approaches and tools for a design artifacts creation and a development process organization. Such a model will make it possible to search for software projects, considering their domain features and properties of design artifacts and development process. Various data mining and systems analysis methods can apply to a found set of projects to extract a set of best practices. We described the approach to building the information retrieval module for the intelligent design repository in this paper. Also, we presented the model of a software system project. We considered the algorithm for indexing a software system project to build the information retrieval module index. There is a measure of a distance between a search query and an index element of the information retrieval module. We proposed the algorithm for calculating the relevance of an index element to a search query. The article also provides examples of the work of the information retrieval module for the intelligent design repository."

Developing a theoretical framework for enhancing green project approaches via Agile methodology,Scientific Reports,,,,10.1038/s41598-024-78613-x,Ahmed. AliHesham. Sameh,2024,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-78613-x,Article,"The application of green building approaches has significantly increased in many countries and buildings, accompanied by the development of numerous standards and methodologies for their implementation. Despite these efforts, not all risks and challenges facing green projects have been eliminated in some regions. Issues such as financing difficulties, budget overruns, and schedule delays continue to pose significant challenges. As a result, no substantial improvements have been made in the approach to green projects. Therefore, this study aims to develop a theoretical framework that enhances the approach to green projects. By utilizing the AGILE methodology, specifically SCRUM, the most significant risks facing green projects were identified and converted into indicators based on prior studies. Furthermore, Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology, particularly Green BIM (GBIM), was employed to create tools and elements to address these challenges, leading to the development of a conceptual framework capable of providing solutions. This framework was built around 30 indicators, whose weights were determined through an electronic questionnaire involving 140 specialists in green projects, AGILE methodology, and BIM technology. Assistance from academic experts was also sought. The results of the questionnaire, analyzed using statistical methods, contributed to the development of a theoretical framework aimed at improving the approach to green projects."

The finding of the research indicates that virtual team attributes, such as technological augmentation, team dynamics, diversity, and strategic decision-making, have a significant impact on software project outcomes. In a Virtual team setting, the model developed during this research will serve as a valuable resource for the project leaders to comprehend the factors that influence project success and assist in implementing policies towards successful software projects. The research findings substantiate the previous research done for Virtual teams in developed countries, and the dimensions are evaluated in a completely new environment for developing countries like India."
Breaking barriers: enhancing construction and demolition waste management in Egyptian residential projects,Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy,,,,10.1007/s10098-024-02999-5,Ahmed Farouk KineberSherif MostafaAli Hassan AliSherif MohamedAhmed Osama Daoud,2024,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10098-024-02999-5,Article,"Abstract Integrating sustainability principles in all stages of construction decision-making is crucial for achieving optimal benefits while maintaining the functionality of residential projects. However, limited research has focused on identifying and analyzing primary barriers to effective construction and demolition waste management (C&DWM) in Egypt’s residential construction projects and their impact on sustainable waste management practices. This study aimed to address the question: “What barriers impede the implementation of C&DWM in Egyptian residential projects?” Previous research highlighted general barriers to C&DWM, which were contextualized using a questionnaire survey in the Egyptian building sector. The survey targeted industry practitioners in Egypt, specifically those working in various construction companies with expertise in construction management or civil engineering. The survey received responses from 90 out of 120 participants, resulting in a high response rate of 75%. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) reveals that barriers to C&DWM can be classified into four distinct constructs: culture, resources, efficiency, and procurement. These constructs were integrated into a model using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings underscore that cultural barriers emerge as the primary hindrance to effective C&DWM implementation, whereas procurement barriers were found to have the least impact. This study makes a substantial academic contribution by providing empirical evidence on the classification and impact of various barriers to C&DWM in a developing country context, specifically Egypt. It introduces a novel application of PLS-SEM to model the relationships between cultural, resource, efficiency, and procurement barriers and their effect on C&DWM implementation. Furthermore, the study offers practical insights and actionable recommendations for policymakers and industry practitioners in developing nations, emphasizing the need for targeted strategies to address these identified barriers. The methodological approach and findings of this study fill a significant gap in the existing literature and can serve as a reference for future research in similar contexts, contributing to the broader discourse on sustainable construction management.

Consequently, the complexity of these systems has been increasing not only in terms of the physical layer but also the logical layer. Leveraging the advantages provided by digital processing, in various telecommunications scenarios, the possibility of developing a robust software-based layer has been proposed. This implies that the study and simulation of algorithms applied at all stages of the transmission chain have become significantly important. The main focus of the study of data processing algorithms in satellites has been on the communication stages that require greater capacity and resources in data management. One of these stages is analogue-to-digital conversion, where the process of transforming the original information source into the binary form to be manipulated by the rest of the system is carried out, as this transformation determines the functioning of the subsequent stages of the communications system. This work aims to study the delta modulation algorithm, as it is one of the most widely used sampling and quantisation techniques in wireless communication systems, with the purpose of understanding its behaviour in satellite telemetry transmission scenarios."

However, there exists a notable gap in the comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted factors and mechanisms influencing CLCB. Therefore, this study aims to systematically identify the factors influencing CLCB in China, examine the interrelationships among these factors, and pinpoint the key determinants. Based on topic modeling of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), influencing factors are identified firstly from the pertinent literature. Subsequently, the causality degree and centrality degree between these factors are assessed by the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), followed by the establishment of a hierarchical structure using the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) method, culminating in the identification of pivotal factors. Findings reveal that (1) 21 influential factors influencing CLCB are identified. (2) “Incentive policies for relevant stakeholders” and “Low-carbon regulation and supervision” emerge as key influences. (3) CLCB should be guided by policy and subjective awareness, fortified by market and management support, underpinned by technology, and directly driven by economic considerations. This research furnishes valuable insights for promoting low-carbon development during the construction phase, thereby assisting the construction sector in achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality."

Therefore, the adoption of software engineering facilities such as development processes, modeling languages, patterns, among others, have been proposed to assist in transformation development. This paper discusses currently facilities used to develop model transformations from a systematic literature review result. To better organize the currently aspects found, we structure the proposals according to a classification concerning software engineering development technologies in order to help developers and researchers in searching by solutions and challenges."
Detect Acute Porphyrias in Emergency Departments (DePorED) – a pilot study,Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases,,,,10.1186/s13023-023-02768-5,Eva Diehl-WieseneckerSabine BlaschkeNils WohmannIlja KubischThomas StauchMona MainertFranziska HelmSabine von WegererDavid PittrowJorge FrankUlrich StölzelRajan Somasundaram,2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13023-023-02768-5,Article,"Background Acute porphyrias (APs) are a group of rare metabolic diseases related to a disturbed heme biosynthesis. Symptoms may first occur as life threatening attacks, comprising abdominal pain and/or variable neuro-psychiatric symptoms, thus leading to presentation in emergency departments (ED) first. Due to the low prevalence, diagnosis of AP is often missed, even after readmission to the ED. Therefore, strategies are needed to consider APs in ED patients with unexplained abdominal pain, especially since early and adequate treatment will avoid an unfavorable clinical course. Aim of this prospective study was to investigate the prevalence of APs in ED patients and thus, addressing feasibility of screening for rare diseases, such as APs in the real life setting. Methods From September 2019 to March 2021, patients presenting to the ED of three German tertiary care hospitals with moderate to severe prolonged abdominal pain (Visual Analog Scale, VAS > 4 out of 10 points) not otherwise explained were screened and prospectively enrolled. In addition to standard of care (SOC) diagnostics a blood and urine sample for plasma fluorescence scan and biochemical porphyrin analysis were sent to a certified German porphyria laboratory. Results Overall, of 653 screened patients, 68 patients (36 females; mean age 36 years) were included for biochemical porphyrin analysis. No patient with AP was detected. The most frequent discharge diagnoses included “abdominal and digestive symptoms” (n = 22, 32%), “gastrooesophageal diseases” (n = 18, 27%), “infectious bowel disease” (n = 6, 9%) and “biliopancreatic diseases” (n = 6, 9%). Although not primarily addressed, we observed an increase in knowledge of the ED staffs at all study sites regarding our screening algorithm and thus, awareness for APs. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, we performed the first prospective screening project for APs in the ED. Although we detected no patient with AP in this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a multicenter screening process for APs by building up a well-working infrastructure comprising laboratory testing as well as data management. This enables the set-up of a larger scale revised follow-up study with a central focus on structured education, thus, possibly acting as blueprint for other rare diseases."

Moreover, many studies focused on the issue during the COVID-19 pandemic, but few of them addressed the issue in the post-COVID-19 period. This study aims to investigate the interactions among financial compensation, work-life balance, job satisfaction, and type of work arrangement (hybrid or remote) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Data were collected through a structured survey. The sample was composed of 125 responses, well balanced across various characteristics. Using structural equation modeling, a hypothetical model was developed, and upon confirmation of the validity and reliability of the measures, the model was tested. The empirical results indicate that financial compensation does not directly affect job satisfaction, while work-life balance has a statistically significant and positive direct effect on job satisfaction. The type of work arrangement does not significantly moderate any of the mentioned relationships. Theoretical and practical implications are further discussed."
Lean Adoption Barriers for Trade Contractors,Proceedings of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineering Annual Conference 2021,,,,10.1007/978-981-19-0968-9_17,E. AsadianR. LeichtJ. Messner,2023,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-0968-9_17,Conference paper,"Lean Construction has proven to be highly beneficial to the construction industry; however, adoption at the trade contractor level is lagging. This study seeks to identify the barriers that hamper the successful implementation of lean principles and methods to understand the reasons for the lagging adoption by stakeholders that should benefit the most. A comprehensive review of previous literature identified several categorizations for barriers; however, none emphasized trade contractors. 29 barriers were identified and defined through a detailed literature review. These barriers were then clustered into seven main factors affecting the implementation of lean initiatives under the proposed framework. This framework facilitates the investigation of construction companies’ potential barriers when deciding to start implementing lean. The analysis revealed that the three most frequent barriers were lack of teamwork, multi-layer subcontracting, and lack of long-term philosophy. Additionally, seven barriers are recognized as the potential barriers specifically relevant to the trade contractors: lack of teamwork and technical capabilities, poor communication between parties, minimum involvement of workers, lack of integration of the production chain, quality of materials, high turnover of the workforce, and employee tolerance of untidy workspaces. The findings provide insight into the possible obstacles that exist to hinder the implementation of lean practices among trade contractors. Firms that do not recognize these barriers will suffer from organizational inefficiency regarding needed improvement efforts and where these endeavors should be focused. Understanding the root causes of the low rate of lean adaptation can assist in developing solutions to address barriers and facilitate lean implementation."

It consists of a risk data management module, a methodology for its systematic application and a tool that automates the process."
Online cross-project approach with project-level similarity for just-in-time software defect prediction,Empirical Software Engineering,,,,10.1007/s10664-024-10551-8,Cong TengLiyan SongXin Yao,2024,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-024-10551-8,Article,"The adoption of additional Other Project (OP) data has shown to be effective for online Just-In-Time Software Defect Prediction (JIT-SDP). However, state-of-the-art online Cross-Project (CP) methods, such as All-In-One (AIO) and Filtering, which operate at the data-level, encounter the difficulties in balancing diversity and validity of the selected OP data, which can negatively impact predictive performance. AIO may select unrelated OP data, resulting in a lack of validity, while Filtering tends to select OP data that closely resemble Target Project (TP) data, leading to a lack of diversity. To address this validity-vs-diversity challenge, a promising approach is to utilize an online project-level OP selection methodology. This approach selects instructive other projects that exhibit similarities to TP and can positively impact predictive performance, achieving better data validity compared to AIO and maintaining higher diversity compared to Filtering. To accomplish this, we propose a project-level Cross-Project method with Similarity (CroPS), which employs appropriate project-level similarity metrics to identify instructive other projects for model updating over time. CroPS applies a specified threshold to determine the selection of other projects at any given moment. Furthermore, we propose an ensemble-like framework called Multi-threshold CroPS (Multi-CroPS), which incorporates multiple threshold options for selecting other projects and poses the importance of defect-inducing changes. Experimental results based on 23 open-source projects validate the effectiveness of our project-level metrics for calculating similarities between projects. The results also demonstrate that CroPS significantly enhances the predictive performance while reducing computational costs compared to existing data-level CP approaches. Moreover, Multi-CroPS achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art CP approaches including our CroPS."

Higher productivity through these systems also offers a solution to potential workforce shortages. However, introducing such IS often faces challenges, including user reluctance to change existing habits and software. For example, low willingness to change and poor communication exacerbate this problem, especially with suites like Microsoft 365, which help transitioning from software to cloud-based, collaborative solutions. The key challenge in integrating new applications is engaging users effectively, as poor engagement leads to unsatisfactory experiences and poor value. Understanding user needs and providing support are crucial for promoting adoption. For collaborative IS, such as conversational agents, their value depends on user interaction. Addressing these challenges requires a structured method focusing on user feedback and requirements during the lifecycle design phase. This study examines the introduction and increased adoption of Microsoft 365 in a multinational organization. Despite expectations for high usage, fostering user engagement remains a significant hurdle. Therefore, we developed a systematic, survey-based approach in a case organization, aiming to stimulate user interaction by repeated fostering of interactions, and, consequently, add value for users."
The Design of a New IT Governance Framework to Optimize the Utilization of Information Technology for MSME,Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Computational Science and Technology,,,,10.1007/978-981-19-8406-8_12,Yusuf WibisonoYanti Rosmunie,2023,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-8406-8_12,Conference paper,"The presence of industry 4.0 brings various conveniences in operational and marketing processes for companies, including micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). All companies are required to be able to utilize information technology in order to win the competition. Based on 2019 data, the number of MSMEs in Indonesia is 99.99% of the total number of companies and contributes to a GDP of 61.1%. With many MSMEs in Indonesia, their existence also opens up wider job opportunities with more equitable economic benefits for the community. To win the competition, MSMEs must optimize the use of information technology. To use information technology to align with business goals, MSMEs need IT Governance. Implementation of the IT Governance Framework generally runs in large companies. Constraints for small companies are usually related to the cost and complexity of the existing IT Governance Framework. This paper aims to develop an IT Governance Framework suitable for MSMEs and can be applied easily and efficiently. The initial stage is to develop a framework based on a literature review of the existing frameworks, namely COBIT, ITIL, CMMI, TOGAF, and relevant research. The proposed framework consists of six main components: Architectural Readiness, Technology Adoption, Service Management, Continuous Improvement, Leader Engagement, and Network Capability. Subsequently, improvements were made to the proposed framework by conducting quantitative and qualitative research on MSMEs to produce a better framework. As a validation stage, the enhanced framework will then be discussed with experts and the response from the MSMEs. Thus, it is hoped that the proposed framework can help MSMEs effectively utilize information technology that supports and is in line with MSME's business values."

This system that we built allows us to learn the transcription of polysemous words in the Mooré language. In our intelligent tutoring system, the knowledge of the learning domain is stored in a relational database. This way of storing knowledge does not allow the sharing and reuse of the corpus of knowledge in our learning domain by other systems. So, we proposed to move to an ontological representation of the knowledge of our system. Ontologies are one of the Artificial Intelligence approaches that are used to represent the domain knowledge of intelligent tutoring systems. They constitute a solution for representing and sharing knowledge. Thus, this ontological representation that we propose will make it possible to respond to the limits mentioned above. Before presenting, the learning knowledge ontology of our system, we will briefly describe the adopted methodology for building our intelligent tutoring system. This methodology that we present here could be used as an approach to facilitate the building of intelligent tutoring system in other tone languages. It will also show the domain schema of the system from which we built the present ontology."

However, the extent of its influence within the domain of large-scale agile (LSA) software development teams remains underexplored. This research investigates the multifaceted dimensions of psychological safety within LSA teams, examining both its precursors and outcomes. This study conducted semi-structured interviews with software professionals actively involved in LSA projects within a Swedish software consultancy company. The findings underscore the intricate nature of establishing a psychologically safe environment within LSA teams, revealing it as a multidimensional construct necessitating a proactive leadership approach, fostering open communication, and cultivating an ecosystem of constructive feedback. The study highlights the critical importance of intentionally shaping teams to facilitate continuous learning, ensuring remuneration safety, and implementing a comprehensive onboarding process for incoming team members. By fostering psychologically safe settings, LSA teams enhanced teamwork dynamics, heightened job satisfaction, and facilitation continuous learning and development. Notably, the absence of such an environment exacerbates the phenomenon of brain drain, exposing the tangible consequences of overlooking this fundamental aspect of organizational culture. This study proposes avenues for future research directions, aiming to further unravel the nuances of psychological safety and its cascading effects within the realm of contemporary LSA software development context."

We conducted two complementary studies, an experiment and participatory design sessions, investigating the effect that varying levels of AI explainability and AI autonomy have on the participants’ perceived trust and competence of an AI teammate to address this research gap. The results of the experiment were counter-intuitive, where the participants actually perceived the lower explainability agent as both more trustworthy and more competent. The participatory design sessions further revealed how a team’s need to know influences when and what teammates need explained from AI teammates. Based on these findings, several design recommendations were developed for the HCI community to guide how AI teammates should share decision information with their human counterparts considering the careful balance between trust and competence in human-AI teams."

Optimized ensemble machine learning model for software bugs prediction,Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering,,,,10.1007/s11334-022-00506-x,Femi JohnsonOlayiwola OluwatobiOlusegun FolorunsoAlomaja Victor OjumuAlatishe Quadri,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11334-022-00506-x,Article,"Software accuracy and efficiency checks are becoming of paramount interest to system users before utilization. As a result, twenty-first-century programmers are consciously developing less buggy, highly efficient, and robust software with a higher degree of accuracy. Occasionally, undetected bugs in large software due to the complexity of codes and other associated parametric attributes cause hardware to malfunction. In this paper, an ensemble model of Logistic Regression and Extra tree classifier algorithms is deployed on parametric software attributes for the accurate classification and prediction of software bugs. The implementation was performed on different platforms (WEKA, MATLAB and PyCharm) to determine the rate of memory utilization, optimize prediction time, maximize the model’s efficiency and compare accuracy rankings among similar machine models. A publicly available software defects dataset from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) containing 16,962 instances and 38 attributes for software defects prediction was collected, pre-processed and used in the implementation of this study. The collected data were vectorized, subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction based on ranking values and divided in the ratio 3:2 for training and testing of the ensemble model classifier, respectively, on new sets of buggy software datasets. The result from the ensembled model showed a significant increase from 96.7–97.8% in the prediction accuracy of the un-vectorized dataset to vectorized dataset. An appreciable decrease in the prediction time (19.7 s) of the vectorized dataset was also observed against the initial time (26.9 s) recorded for the un-vectorized dataset. In addition, memory utilization for vectorized datasets increased during the training phase due to the number of bits but got reduced at the final testing phase of the software bug prediction. However, the overall accuracy of 97.8% recorded by the optimized ensemble model for buggy software prediction proved the model’s capability to accurately classify and predict buggy software with efficient memory utilization at optimal time duration."

Due to it, developers had to become aware of the existing techniques and tools to carry out privacy requirements elicitation. Extending our previous work, we have investigated the actions taken by organizations regarding the LGPD, specifically in software development, considering the perception of agile development teams after two years of the LGPD implementation. In addition, we also investigated the perception of an agile team regarding the practices, techniques, and tools previously cited by practitioners as potential solutions for use in this context, along with techniques already in use in the current context. We have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) and selected 36 primary studies. Furthermore, we have conducted a survey with 53 IT practitioners and semi-structured interviews with ten practitioners. The LGPD principles are known by most agile teams and are being implemented by the organizations, although the existing tools to support privacy requirements elicitation are still underused by agile teams. Moreover, agile teams consider that software requirements and software construction are the most impacted areas of knowledge by the LGPD, and most of them use user stories in privacy requirements elicitation. Our findings reveal that agile teams and Brazilian organizations are more concerned with user data privacy issues after the LGPD became effective. However, agile teams still face challenges in privacy requirements elicitation."

Strategic pragmatism orientation: a framework for navigating recurring crises and the ‘zeitenwende’ with stability and agility,Review of Managerial Science,,,,10.1007/s11846-025-00903-z,Ricarda B. BounckenSascha Kraus,2025,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11846-025-00903-z,Article,"The current reality presents a dilemma: firms must navigate the tension between flexibility and efficiency, particularly in the face of recurring or prolonged environmental turbulence − as is the case today, with a potential caesura marked by uncertain economic and political conditions and increasing multipolarity (‘Zeitenwende’). To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel concept: strategic pragmatism orientation. Pragmatism reflects the idea that actions are evaluated and adjusted based on their immediate practicality. Strategic pragmatism extends this notion by encompassing proactive actions that are likewise assessed for their practical utility. A strategic pragmatism orientation captures the proactive and reactive stance of a firm or its top management in experimenting with actions evaluated through the lens of immediate practical outcomes. By combining the reactive essence of pragmatism with the forward-looking approach of strategic pragmatism orientation, firms can establish stable foundations in key areas while maintaining flexibility elsewhere. This orientation enables firms to navigate severe and recurring turbulence by making decisions grounded in immediate consequences, yet with an eye toward long-term adaptability. The set of papers in this special issue explores specific domains where a strategic pragmatism orientation can be applied to address significant environmental turbulence. Furthermore, the contributions highlight how strategic pragmatism orientation complements other strategic frameworks, such as entrepreneurial orientation and digital orientation."

Modern domain-specific (e.g., aerospace, industrial control, defense, and medical) embedded systems include safety-critical applications whose failures would result in catastrophic events. Such systems avoid the general-purpose operating system and leverage RTOS to work in increasingly dynamic and harsh environments. Moreover, many of these systems operate over networks, making them susceptible to various attacks. Hence, the reliability and security of embedded systems running on top of RTOS are equally important. Although research on these two crucial components has been conducted and presented for traditional operating systems, there has been a significant research thrust on RTOS due to the recent emergence of the internet of things (IoT). This article presents an in-depth and systematic review of the security and reliability of safety-critical systems. We highlight the best practices and recent research efforts and their feasibility in the context of safety-critical RTOS. We compare the solutions qualitatively and discuss their pros and cons.

Interdisciplinary Competencies for AI-Enabled Co-creation: Mapping Public Sector Skills in Poland and Ukraine,Electronic Participation,,,,10.1007/978-3-032-02515-9_9,Nina RizunYuliia BartashevskaMagdalena CiesielskaHanna Bondarovych,2026,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-032-02515-9_9,Conference paper,"The growing complexity of public sector governance in the digital era demands a fundamental rethinking of how services are designed, delivered, and governed. Co-creation has emerged as a central paradigm, promoting collaboration between governments, citizens, and diverse stakeholders to improve inclusiveness and responsiveness. In parallel, the integration of digital technologies, particularly AI and data-driven approaches, is reshaping the competencies required in public administration. These developments bring not only new technical expectations but also raise ethical, regulatory, and sustainability challenges. This study examines how such interdisciplinary demands are reflected in public sector labor markets through a comparative case study of Poland and Ukraine – two countries actively undergoing public sector digital transformation, but situated within different political and institutional contexts. Based on an analysis of 120 job vacancies, we examine required knowledge areas and skill sets across six dimensions: Co-creation, Ethics, Evidence-based decision-making, Sustainability, AI, and Legal & Regulation. Our findings highlight notable differences between the two cases – Poland’s stronger orientation toward participatory governance and Ukraine’s emphasis on digital and AI transformation. At the same time, the analysis reveals substantial gaps in the articulation and integration of cross-cutting competencies, underscoring the need for systemic investment in workforce development and interdisciplinary education aligned with emerging public sector challenges."

Yet, scholars also raise concerns that an emphasis on digital resource configurability may overlook important contexual dimensions, leading to increased managerialism and reduced legitimacy within new public sector paradigms. This paper explores the concept of public service ecosystems, both as an analytical lens and a subject of critique, focusing on the shifts brought about by digitalization, while scrutinizing the optimism and technological focus that often accompany these transformations. Drawing on a longitudinal case study from the Swedish public sector, we unveil how a public service ecosystem, facilitated by modular open-source architecture and multi-actor engagement, faces challenges including i) demand-supply gaps in digital services, ii) governance issues, and iii) integration between digital and physical channels. As such the framework of public service ecosystem is challenged as a sometimes naïve idea underplaying the complexity of e-service development in the public sector. At the same time it worked as a lens to structure and nuance the findings and bridge the gap between technological and contextual focus, and informed suggestions for further research."

The research compares individual machine learning models such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, AdaBoost, LASSO, and neural networks with stacked models over two phases. In Phase 1, five stacking models were developed, using SVR, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LASSO, and a neural network as base models. In Phase 2, four stacking models incorporated two neural networks as base models combined with different metamodels. The results indicate that stacking models with SVR as the metamodel outperformed individual models and other ensemble methods, especially in terms of MAE, MSE, MMRE, and MdMRE evaluation metrics. Friedman Test and Nemenyi Post-Hoc Test validated the results. These findings suggest that using SVR as the metamodel leads to improved accuracy and reliability in effort estimation, offering significant advantages for project management by enhancing predictive precision and optimizing resource allocation."

Therefore, this study tested the relationship between knowledge leadership (KL) and project success (PS), along with the mediating role of knowledge sharing (KS) and the moderating role of employees’ work-related curiosity (WRC). Data were collected in three-time lags from 258 employees from information technology (IT) organizations across Pakistan. Purposive sampling technique was employed to approach the respondents. It was found that knowledge leadership facilitated subordinates and created a knowledge sharing environment that enabled the co-workers to share their expertise to accomplish tasks. This study provokes that it is vital for the organizations to choose managers with knowledge leadership capabilities that will promote the ability of the employees to share knowledge and devise approaches to provoke curiosity. There is no previous study identifying the relationship between knowledge leadership and project success. However, innovativeness requires refined mechanisms of knowledge sharing for continuous improvement and corrections."

One of these activities corresponds to implementation. Effort is used for managers for budgeting software projects. Managers commonly take as reference the effort percentage of any SDLC activity with respect to the total SDLC effort. Regarding implementation activity, we found a range between 0.31 and 27.39% for new projects, and between 0.15 and 32.30% for maintained projects, which could cause uncertainty in managers. Therefore, we propose a new nature-inspired algorithm termed Mexican Axolotl Optimization with Random Incorporation (MAORI) as a general metaheuristic for predicting the implementation effort of projects. We embedded statistical regression equations (SRE) in the MAORI to obtain a MAORI-SRE algorithm. Results showed that MAORI-SRE prediction accuracy was better than SRE when optimized through particle swarm optimization, and genetic algorithms."

In previous techniques, the challenge to address is determining the number and size of clusters and optimization to stabilize the cost and efficacy of the strategy. To overcome all the existing drawbacks; this research study proposes test case reduction and Support-based Whale Optimization Algorithm (SWOA) for distributed agile software development using regression testing. The purpose of this research study is to look into regression testing strategies in agile development teams and to find out what they are optimum clustered test cases. The proposed strategy is divided into two stages: prioritization as well as selection. Prioritization and selection are carried out once the test instances have been retrieved and grouped. The test case clusters are sorted and prioritized in this stage to ensure that the most critical instances are chosen first. During this stage, the test case clusters undergo sorting and prioritization to guarantee that the most essential cases are selected initially. Second, the SWOA is used to choose test cases with a greater frequency of failure or coverage criterion. The results of the assessment metrics show that the proposed approach outperforms other current regression testing strategies substantially. Based on experimental findings, our proposed approach betters existing methods in terms of information performance."

The final objective of this study is to reflect the real state of project management as performed on Moroccan companies in order to come out with recommendations that will give companies the opportunity to optimize the control of their small and large projects by being inspired by the meaningful and interesting experience of the various projects carried out in Morocco. Each project is unique, and its progress cannot be generalized to other projects. This is why it is important for me to study the experience of several projects in several sectors and fields of activity and to provide a vision from several angles and by different profiles. In this communication, I will start by briefly explaining the way I chose to develop my study in order to collect real data from the field. Then make a focus on an analysis for business development by the project management in Moroccan companies. I will analyze the interest that Moroccan companies give to project management and see if they always achieve their objectives within a project methodology structure. And finally zoom in on a part of the results concerning the first parameter clearly causing problems on projects which is the level of information and competences of the projects teams. In other words, the importance that Moroccan companies attach to the organization of training in project management for the benefit of its teams in order to ensure the desired level of competence."

Therefore, knowledge about how leader–member exchange (LMX) influences IT employees’ behaviors is of great interest to managers and researchers. Additionally, this issue is under-addressed in the literature, particularly in connection with professional service firms. More studies are needed that examine IT employees’ behavior in the professional service field. This study investigated the effects of LMX on job demands, job satisfaction, and turnover intention by applying the job demands-resources (JD-R) model and LMX theory. Cross-sectional survey data from 251 self-report questionnaires were collected from IT employees. The research results revealed that LMX is negatively associated with job demands and negatively moderates the relationship between job demands and job satisfaction. High job demands may increase turnover intention among IT employees. Our findings have critical implications for job demand-resource issues related to IT professionals, how supervisors handle and offer support and adequate resources to employees in IT service projects, and how supervisors support their subordinates in coping with project requirements and ensuring project success. The comprehensive implications of the findings of this study can help future stakeholders enhance their understanding of IT service projects."

Developing high-quality quantum software applications, called quantum software engineering, has recently gained attention. However, quantum software development faces challenges related to code quality. A recent study found that many open-source quantum programs are affected by quantum-specific code smells, with long circuit being the most common. While the study provided relevant insights into the prevalence of code smells in quantum circuits, it did not explore the potential effect of transpilation, a necessary step for executing quantum computer programs, on the emergence of code smells. Indeed, transpilation might alter those characteristics employed to detect the presence of a smell on a circuit. To address this limitation, we present a new study investigating the impact of transpilation on quantum-specific code smells and how different target gate sets affect the results. We conducted experiments on 17 open-source quantum programs alongside a set of 100 synthetic circuits. We found that transpilation can significantly alter the metrics that are used to detect code smells, even into previously smell-free circuits, with the long circuit smell being the most susceptible to transpilation. Furthermore, the choice of the gate set significantly influences the presence and severity of code smells in transpiled circuits, highlighting the need for careful gate set selection to mitigate their impact. These findings have implications for circuit optimization and high-quality quantum software development. Further research is needed to understand the consequences of code smells and their potential impact on quantum computations, considering the characteristics and constraints of different gate sets and hardware platforms."

Taking an ethnomethodological and conversation analytic approach, this paper investigates how participants establish and maintain progressivity in hybrid meetings ensuring the continuous flow of work. Based on video-recorded data from hybrid daily Scrum meetings at a software development company, we focused on instances where participants are interrupted by problems diminishing the meeting progressivity. Our micro analysis shows that in the meetings resolution of work-progress related trouble is prioritized over the resolution of technical problems. To establish and maintain progressivity, participants orient to the organizational imperatives while simultaneously circumventing technical problems arising in the meetings. In overcoming problems, the different layers of organizational goals and meeting goals are accounted for in the common effort to get work done by (a) reminding of the time budget; (b) sticking to the agenda (c) reconfiguring responsibilities to fill in for missing members; and (d) referencing shared resources that reflect team progress. This analysis suggests that to improve hybrid and/or online meetings, practitioners should aim to increase the social intelligibility of activities scheduled for meetings by defining improved and specific meeting frameworks that promote continuity and reduce ambiguity."

A data-driven cost estimation model for agile development based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and AdamW optimization,Journal of King Saud University Computer and Information Sciences ,,,,10.1007/s44443-025-00058-7,Xiaoyan ZhaoXin XiongZulkefli MansorRozilawati RazaliMohd Zakree Ahmad NazriLiangyu Li,2025,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44443-025-00058-7,Article,"Over the past two decades, agile development has become a mainstream software engineering paradigm due to its flexibility and iterative nature. However, accurate cost estimation in agile projects remains challenging, mainly due to frequent requirement changes and data scarcity. Traditional estimation methods and existing machine learning models often fail to adapt effectively to the dynamic agile environment. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel cost estimation model combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with the AdamW optimizer. KAN captures complex nonlinear relationships through hierarchical polynomial mapping, making it suitable for modeling dynamic cost variations. AdamW improves convergence speed and stability with adaptive learning rates and momentum mechanisms. To alleviate data scarcity, the SMOTE-NC technique is applied to generate 1000 synthetic samples based on 75 actual agile project data. K-fold cross-validation is used to enhance the model’s generalization ability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed KAN-AdamW model achieves superior performance, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 11,504.08 and a Mean Relative Error (MRE) of 0.12-outperforming traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and function point-based models. The model also shows strong performance in accuracy and R-squared metrics, indicating high predictive stability and precision. This study offers a data-driven and effective solution for agile cost estimation and provides empirical support for addressing data limitations using SMOTE-NC. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of KAN for broader applications in cost modeling."

Therefore, it is not often probable aimed at antedating the precise guesses in the software development effort’s estimation. Existent works have established numerous techniques aimed at SEE, however, no consensus regarding the methodology and settings apt to generate precise estimates are attained. Aimed at boosting the accuracy and decrementing the training time, this research methodology presented an ANOVA convolutional neural network (A-CNN) methodology for effort estimation (EE). Initially, the input data are pre-processed, then the features are taken out as of the pre-processed data and the vital features are chosen by employing the linear scaling-based deer hunting optimization (LS-DHO) technique. Then, the weighting value is enumerated aimed at the features selected. Utilizing the modified K-harmonic means (MKHM) algorithm, the similar values are clustered centred on those values. Consequently, the data clustered are inputted to the A-CNN algorithm. It estimates the software project developments’ effort. In an experiential evaluation, the methodology proposed is examined with the existent research methodologies centred upon the accuracy, mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE), PRED, and also execution time metrics. The methodology proposed attains excellent outcomes analogized to the existent methodologies."

These phases are implemented irrespective of type of software methodology such as traditional or agile followed during the establishment of software as well as effectually documented. Also this practice is executed in all technical environment, i.e., software companies as well as academic courses were software projects are developed. Software project development is having utmost prominence and credit in educational prospectus for computer science and engineering. Apart from fundamental stages such as requirement engineering, designing, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance it is found that IT industries also strictly and mandatory focuses on issues such as software risk management, software scheduling, and tracking as well as effort estimation and distribution related to time, budget, and testing. Also these IT industries consider and execute various testing techniques during software project development. For this proposed research framework 122 large software projects documentation were taken into consideration. For simplicity and better comprehensive research domain-based classification was used to classify these software projects into four main heads termed as—(a) Desktop Application, (b) Web Desktop, (c) Mobile Application, and (d) Portal. Similarly, the test effort estimation such as (a) Delphi technique, (b) Analogy-Based Estimation, (c) Software Size-Based Estimation, (d) Test Case Enumeration-Based Estimation, (e) Task or Activity-Based Estimation, and (f) Use Case Test Points are considered for this research purpose. We found that these testing techniques were not considered by students while developing academic software projects as well as no due weightage is given to these testing techniques and test effort by academic courses of computer science and engineering. The main objective behind ranking these techniques was to indicate that which technique is more suitable for software projects carried out by postgraduate courses in computer science. To achieve this purpose a survey is conducted as a part of research by considering 31 Computer Science Academicians to rank these software test effort estimation techniques. The result of experimentation shows that highest rank is allotted to Use Case Points-Based Estimation whereas second highest rank is assigned to Task-Based Estimation while Test Case-Based Estimation gained third maximum rank."

Beyond probability-impact matrices in project risk management: A quantitative methodology for risk prioritisation,Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,,,,10.1057/s41599-024-03180-5,F. AcebesJ. M. González-VaronaA. López-ParedesJ. Pajares,2024,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41599-024-03180-5,Article,"The project managers who deal with risk management are often faced with the difficult task of determining the relative importance of the various sources of risk that affect the project. This prioritisation is crucial to direct management efforts to ensure higher project profitability. Risk matrices are widely recognised tools by academics and practitioners in various sectors to assess and rank risks according to their likelihood of occurrence and impact on project objectives. However, the existing literature highlights several limitations to use the risk matrix. In response to the weaknesses of its use, this paper proposes a novel approach for prioritising project risks. Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is used to perform a quantitative prioritisation of risks with the simulation software MCSimulRisk. Together with the definition of project activities, the simulation includes the identified risks by modelling their probability and impact on cost and duration. With this novel methodology, a quantitative assessment of the impact of each risk is provided, as measured by the effect that it would have on project duration and its total cost. This allows the differentiation of critical risks according to their impact on project duration, which may differ if cost is taken as a priority objective. This proposal is interesting for project managers because they will, on the one hand, know the absolute impact of each risk on their project duration and cost objectives and, on the other hand, be able to discriminate the impacts of each risk independently on the duration objective and the cost objective."

In this part we explain the recent network evolution and the concept of virtualization, focusing on the management and orchestration of virtualized network resources. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is a new paradigm for changing the way networks are built and operated. Decoupling software implementation from network resources through a virtualization layer introduces a need for developing sets of NFV management and orchestration (MANO) functions. We discuss how this new point of view is highly inspired by the functional programming concepts. We provide examples and exercises on Open Stack virtual technology, and also discuss the challenges and problems inspired by the telecommunication industry. Focus is on the Reliable operation of Management and Orchestration functions of Virtualized resources. These notes provide an introduction to the subject, with the goal of explaining the necessity for new knowledge and skills in the area of network programming. We introduce students to the main problems and the network design principles, methods, and techniques used for their solution. The worked examples and exercises serve students as the teaching material, from which they can learn how to use functional programming to effectively and efficiently coordinate management and orchestration functions in distributed complex systems using NFV."

The study adopted the survey method to collect data in Canada and the United States among the marketing personnel working in firms with at least limited experience in the deployment of BD. The collected data were analyzed with ANOVA and a two-step cluster analysis procedure. The cluster variate included technical, technology management, business/marketing, and relational knowledge constructs with their relevant indicator variables. The profiling of the clusters was also completed. The findings indicate the existence of two sufficiently large clusters among the marketing personnel. They had very different profiles regarding their gender, decision-making role, BD deployment level in their respective firms, and experience level. This research sheds light on the types of marketing analytics personnel required to implement BDMA successfully. The personnel active in BDMA deployment must have relevant experience in technical, technology management, business/marketing, and relational knowledge and possess higher decision-making abilities, which enables their firms to proceed successfully to more advanced levels of BDMA deployment."

Its delay poses risks due to vulnerabilities and defects of software. Despite the high demand to shorten the update lag and keep the software up-to-date, software updates involve factors such as human behavior, program configurations, and system policies, adding variety in the updates of software. Investigating these factors in a real environment poses significant challenges such as the knowledge of software release schedules from the software vendors and the deployment times of programs in each user’s machine. Obtaining software release plans requires information from vendors which is not typically available to public. On the users’ side, tracking each software’s exact update installation is required to determine the accurate update delay. Currently, a scalable and systematic approach is missing to analyze these two sides’ views of a comprehensive set of software. We performed a long term system-wide study of update behavior for all software running in an enterprise by translating the operating system logs from enterprise machines into graphs of binary executable updates showing their complex, and individualized updates in the environment. Our comparative analysis locates risky machines and software with belated or dormant updates falling behind others within an enterprise without relying on any third-party or domain knowledge, providing new observations and opportunities for improvement of software updates. Our evaluation analyzes real data from 113,675 unique programs used by 774 computers over 3 years."

Verma,2024,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13369-024-08826-9,Article,"Code Smell is a term that indicates flaws in design and coding practice. God Class is a type of code smell that shows an irregular distribution of functionalities in large-sized classes. God Classes are less cohesive and more coupled in nature, thereby increasing software maintenance efforts and costs. Refactoring all such classes can disturb other related classes with code smell instances, puzzle the developers, and increase the refactoring budget. This paper proposes an automated method to prioritize God Class smell-associated classes with the fuzzy inference system. The fuzzy inference system is used to fuzzy the selected criteria—number of code smell instances, type of code smells, and changes in history. For effective refactoring, first, we moderate the dataset with the CodeMR tool and then highlight that the prioritization criteria are imperative after detecting code smells. Using five metric-based heuristics, a comparative result analysis is done to determine the fore reason for correlation (40–43%) with our results and the gravity of our prioritization criteria. Finally, we provide a severity index of classes with five type classifications and evaluate runtime performance (in seconds) to improve quality."

However, inherent uncertainties within software module data significantly impede accurate prediction of DD. This paper proposes a novel predictive framework that leverages the strengths of grey system theory and fuzzy logic to address data imprecision in software defect measurement. Our approach introduces a fuzzy grey relational similarity metric that capitalizes on the benefits of both fuzzy logic membership functions and grey relational analysis for similarity assessment. We perform a rigorous evaluation comparing our model with eight established machine learning algorithms across 28 publicly available software datasets. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance, particularly in scenarios characterized by high sparsity levels in the DD variable. We further analyze the model's efficacy across varying data sparsity levels, categorizing datasets into four groups based on sparsity ratios. Our findings reveal the model's dominance over alternative prediction methods in datasets exhibiting high and very high sparsity. Notably, traditional techniques like multi-linear regression and multi-layer perceptron exhibit limitations in handling such challenges within this specific problem domain and data landscape. Conversely, ensemble learning techniques emerge as viable alternatives for datasets with lower sparsity levels."

Due to the complex nature of software projects, estimating development effort has become a challenging task that requires careful consideration, especially in the early project phases, to prevent overestimation and underestimation. Accurate effort estimation helps to estimate the cost of a developing project through effective resource management and project budgeting for manpower. Despite numerous effort estimation models introduced over the past two decades, achieving a satisfactory level of accuracy remains elusive. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model gains more popularity for estimation tasks due to its rapid learning capacity, ability to represent complex nonlinear structures, and adaptability to improperly specified data. This study presents a model called the Two-Stage optimization technique for Software Development Effort Estimation (TSoptEE). Initially, it performs feature selection through a multi-objective improved binary social network search (SNS) algorithm and then optimizes the ANFIS tunable parameters through an improved SNS algorithm to enhance the accuracy of SDEE. The proposed TSoptEE model is compared against existing estimation models and evaluated using seven performance measures over nine software datasets. The obtained results are promising in terms of accuracy and statistical significance tests. This implies that the proposed model can significantly enhance the accuracy of effort estimation."

There has, however, been little consideration to rigorous formation of groups, especially project teams, in software engineering disciplines to improve the outcomes of these groups. Previous studies show that the outcome of groups will be affected by a number of different factors, such as the context in which these groups interact, the characteristics and the behaviour of each individual and the group composition. This research evaluates the extent to which it is possible to enhance the group outcomes by systematically reconstructing the groups of students and hence improve the performances and raise the overall outcome level of a software engineering lecture at two universities, the Alpen-Adria University of Klagenfurt and the Technical University of Košice. An empirical experiment has been carried out involving 69 groups and 140 individuals. The results of this experiment were then compared with historical data of 961 groups (approximately 2,400 students) on group outcomes over a period of 12 years. The findings show statistically significant improvements of the outcomes for those groups that were systematically constructed. These results could enable business leaders and educators to systematically form their groups for improving the outcomes of these groups."

Dillibabu,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-021-01573-5,Article,"Successful project is determined based on its effective performance and prioritization of all unavoidable software project risks. In this paper, the risk evaluation in software projects is done through developing a new hybridized fuzzy-based risk evaluation framework. During decision making process, this proposed scheme has determined and ranked all the significant project risks. Software project risks are better assessed with the incorporation of Intuitionistic fuzzy-based TOPSIS, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-based multi-criteria decision making (ANFIS MCDM), and fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory methods. In order to attain accurate software risk estimation, the ANFIS parameters are adjusted with the help of enhanced crow search algorithm (ECSA). To the ANFIS approach, the ECSA is combined to make free the solutions sticking inside the local optimum and adopting only small changes for the adjustment of ANFIS parameters. NASA 93 dataset with 93 software project values was used to conduct the experimental validation. Experimental outcomes have proved evidently that the software project risks evaluation were done accurately and effectively using proposed integrated fuzzy-based framework."

Given that several systematic reviews on gamification in SE have been published, this paper aims at understanding how gamification has been addressed, simultaneously identifying its impact on SE. As a result of this systematic mapping, we identified 12 secondary studies. The majority of papers reported the usage of points, badges, and leaderboards as game elements in software engineering process, software engineering methods and tools, and software engineering management. Although secondary studies reported a positive impact of gamification, more empirical research is required. In a nutshell, current research focuses on the feasibility of using gamification in different SE areas; however, there is a need for research of application context and for defining variables under study to carry out more sound empirical research."

This enables companies to decrease software development cost and time, access to skillful resources, increase product quality, and the benefit of the 24-hour development model. However, due to geographical, temporal, socio-cultural, and organizational distances, GSD projects face multiple challenges that impede attaining the intended goals and severely impact project planning. Agile planning is an approach, traditionally conducted in a collocated environment, that allows fast-reacting, project progress review, detecting development bottlenecks, and decreasing the misunderstanding between developers and customers. In a distributed setting, agile planning remains severely impacted by the shortage of face-to-face communication. Therefore it’s necessary to consider the team distribution and resulted challenges to adopt a beneficial agile planning process for GSD. Based on different research papers related to Agile Planning of Global Software Development, this paper focuses on the pre-planning phase. It describes the application of this phase in the GSD context, and defines the various activities included as well as all the used repositories."
Information Technology for Determining Risk Levels and Their Priorities in Project Management,"Information Technology for Education, Science, and Technics",,,,10.1007/978-3-031-71804-5_7,Anton MaksymovYurii Tryus,2024,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-71804-5_7,Conference paper,"An important and relevant issue in project management is risk management. One of the most prevalent project risk management tools is the Risk Matrix method, which categorizes risks into three levels: high, medium, and low. This categorization is based on two criteria: the consequence of the risk on the project and the likelihood of its occurrence. However, this methodology occasionally presents challenges in accurately categorizing specific risks. Thus, a new problem revolving around the development of a method that would allow the project manager to accurately classify risks according to different levels of importance without being limited to only two criteria arises under such conditions. The research proposes and justifies a new method for project risk analysis. The new method is a combination of a modified Risk Matrix method, which provides the ability to assess risks with high accuracy on a broader scale and with a greater number of criteria than the traditional Risk Matrix method, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, which determines the priorities and ranks of risks to prevent and mitigate those with the highest priorities first. To implement this method, a Project Risk Management Model (PRMM) has been created. In addition, the authors have developed an algorithm that implements this method. Finally, a new web resource has been developed. This web resource enables the automation of the online risk classification process, determines the priority of risks and their ranks, and also provides the user with recommendations for actions to prevent and eliminate the highest priority risks in the form of a risk register. This resource is based on modern programming languages and technologies. The acquired experimental results confirm the feasibility of applying the developed information technology to solve risk management tasks in projects."

A multi-level measures-driven change impact analysis approach for prioritizing software requirement changes,Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering,,,,10.1007/s11334-025-00614-4,Hela HakimAsma SellamiHanêne Ben-Abdallah,2025,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11334-025-00614-4,Article,"In today’s fast-paced software development environment, organizational survival depends not only on rapid delivery but also on the ability to adapt quickly to evolving requirements. Modern methodologies such as rolling wave planning, evolutionary development, and continuous improvement emphasize early delivery and flexible responses to change. This dynamic nature necessitates effective evaluation of requirement change (RC) requests. However, the absence of a detailed change impact analysis often leads to suboptimal decisions, raising concerns about project success in terms of cost, time, and quality.RC requests can influence various dimensions, including functional requirements (FUR), non-functional requirements (NFR), and project constraints (PRC) (Abran A, Castelo D, Mitwasi GM, Vogelezang F, Aguiar M, Fagg P, Soneira P, Woodward C, Ben-Cnaan P, Lesterhuis A, and Symons C (2015) Glossary of terms for non-functional requirements and project requirements used in software project performance measurement, benchmarking and estimating). As the software project progresses, functional requirements evolve and become increasingly detailed, resulting in varying levels of granularity across the development lifecycle. Early-phase requirements tend to be vague or incomplete, while later stages bring greater clarity. This evolving nature frequently leads to “scope creep,” contributing to delays, cost overruns, and reduced software quality.To address this, we propose a multi-level measures-driven change impact analysis approach for prioritizing RC requests. This approach relies on quantitative assessments conducted at different levels of granularity—namely, the functional level, control structure level, and process level—to guide informed and accurate decision-making. In particular, we leverage COSMIC functional size measurement (The COSMIC Functional Size Measurement Method COSMIC (2020). The Version 5.0, Announcement of Version5.0 of the COSMIC Measurement Manual—March31, 2020) alongside structural size measurement methods (Sellami et al. in Inf Softw Technol 59:222–232, 2015) to evaluate the impact of RC requests on development progress.Our methodology enables both macro-level (functional) and micro-level (structural) impact assessments, helping decision-makers—project managers, analysts, and developers—take appropriate actions. While strategic decisions are supported by process-level metrics, operational decisions benefit from detailed functional and structural measurements. This framework provides a structured, data-driven foundation for managing change across the software lifecycle."

Requirements prioritization helps focus on the most important requirements between the available software requirements. This process is also called preserving core vision according to customer viewpoint or managing the quality requirements. Many requirements prioritization techniques have been proposed in the Software Engineering field. However, one requirement prioritization technique can only be generalized for some software projects. This research effort aims to develop a sustainable hybrid model for requirements prioritization, utilizing critical software project factors. The prioritization technique is shortlisted from a pool of software prioritization techniques, based on these project factors and their quantized scores. The proposed model is equipped with state-of-the-art literature to provide a customized prioritization technique improving the requirements prioritization process for a specific software project. The paper also presents popular software prioritization techniques used in the software industry and an extensive comparison using a thorough empirical analysis. Finally, the quantization of the software project factors for each technique has been assessed for better understanding, and a sustainable hybrid model has been constructed. With the proposed hybrid model, requirements prioritization in software development has been controlled effectively, reducing the failure risks and increasing the overall benefit and success rate. The success of the proposed hybrid approach is verified with two software case studies attaining satisfactory results and improving the organization's productivity by incorporating pivotal software requirements on which all the stakeholders agree. Furthermore, an automated approach will be developed by implementing the proposed approach to benefit from human–machine collaboration, improving user satisfaction by incorporating end-user opinions effectively and timely."

Change leadership, leadership effectiveness, and project complexity are empirically determined to be positively associated with the recovery process based on quantitative data collected from 166 IT project team members. Leadership effectiveness is the variable that impacts the recovery process the most. And, the recovery process significantly affects product success and process success of troubled projects. The findings imply that organizations should focus more on leadership effectiveness to improve recovery processes. To facilitate the process and product success of a project recovery, organizations should rely on a recovery process that includes multiple optional remedies."

It is suggested to use such components of the knowledge base as the risk database and the risk management knowledge repository. The Risk Database contains information on the tasks of IT project implementation, a concise description of problem situations, directions for solving the problem, quantification of risks, and the effectiveness of risk management measures. Updated risk database information, along with implicit knowledge (project stakeholder experience and qualifications, domain laws, etc.), is used to replenish the risk management knowledge repository to derive conclusions and patterns reflecting key project risk management policies."

However, to develop quality software, students should not only possess programming skills, but also have to apply the knowledge and skills of software engineering. This entails the importance of software engineering education. Currently, most software engineering courses were conducted using the traditional teaching strategy. Most students can only recite and understand the pertinent knowledge with concerning software engineering after learning. As mentioned above, this study adopts a learner-centered pedagogy, named flipped classroom, to improve software engineering education. Moreover, in order to promote students’ learning performance before the class in flipped classrooms, this study applies an e-book system, named BookRoll. By using the e-book system, students can learn at anytime and anywhere before the class. Simultaneously, their reading behaviors may be recorded by the system. Teachers can facilitate the student discussions and interactions with peers in the class by capturing and analyzing student reading status and further enhancing their learning performance. To explore students’ learning performance in software engineering courses, students from two classes were invited to learn with different learning approaches (flipped learning approach and flipped learning with e-book system approach). The experimental results showed that the students who learned with the proposed approach outperformed those students who learned with traditional flipped learning approach."

The ratio of software project failure nowadays is growing like a storm in the world. One of the reasons behind this failure proportion is an imprecise and inappropriate estimate of required effort, cost, and budget for particular software project development. The motivation behind our research is to estimate the effort for software development accurately. Accurately estimate effort for software development is one of the most challenging tasks because from a very early stage it requires in-depth study as well as detailed statistics. Participation of members of the team is important during the development of the project along with various activities like domain area, sector, nature, software process methodology, and other resources. All these proofs do not appear in the initial phase of development, but on the other side, they discovered as software growth progresses. Many models proposed for estimating effort related to software development, but only a few are adaptable for effort estimation task in the academic software project. From the study of nearly 600 academic software projects and inputs from more than 30 Software Engineering experts, this research paper proposes an innovative model based on 8 parameters and 24 sub-parameters. Each of the sub-parameters is weighted twice, and the final effort estimation obtained by summation of the individual product of the weight of the parameter and weight of sub-parameter. We have coined the term “ASPEE units” (Academic Software Project Effort Estimation) for the estimated effort."

As the requirement and specification changes as per the software needs, accurate prediction of effort is a difficult task for developing software. This prediction of effort must be calculated accurately to avoid unpredicted results. At the early stages of development, these inaccurate, unreliability, and uncertainty are the drawback of previously developed models. The main aim of the study is to overcome the drawbacks and develop a model for the prediction of the effort of software. A combination of regression analysis and genetic algorithm has been used to develop the model. The model is trained and validated using the ISBSG dataset. The proposed model is compared for performance with a few baseline models. The results show that the proposed model outperforms most of the baseline models against different performance metrics."

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies positively impact the organizations at different level of sustainability. Organizations must understand I4.0 technologies and be prepared to adopt physical and digital technologies to make appropriate decisions to improve their market competitiveness. In this regard, I4.0 readiness and maturity models can support organizations to assess their current maturity status and set up a roadmap for further actions for digital transformation. Integrating sustainability principles with I4.0 can enable socially responsible and environmentally conscious manufacturing in organizations. Also, leveraging I4.0 technologies can optimize resource consumption and reduce waste, which helps manufacturing organizations to achieve market competitiveness and sustainable innovation. In the literature, most of maturity models are developed for or by large enterprises with limited applicability in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Also, maturity items considered in these models are not empirically validated. To fill this research gap, this study proposes a maturity model for SMEs, which is empirically tested in Indian manufacturing organizations and includes 40 maturity items in eight major dimensions that impact sustainability and can help to transform the manufacturing sector towards more resource-efficient and sustainable. A large survey is conducted in the Indian manufacturing organizations to validate these maturity items in the Indian context. Then, a model based on Exploratory factor analysis is proposed in 8 dimensions. The proposed model is validated in four case organizations from pharmaceutical and automobile sectors. The results indicated that base technologies and legal maturity items have higher maturity scores. Based on the study’s findings, implications for practitioners and policymakers are provided to improve maturity levels in manufacturing organizations. The study’s contribution is important and unique for manufacturing organizations as validation of maturity items and maturity model for SMEs with sustainability benefits is non-existent."

To optimize this activity, our main idea is to periodically select relevant measures to be executed (among a set of possible measures) and automatize their analysis by using a dedicated tool. The proposed solution is integrated in a whole PaaS platform called MEASURE. The tools supporting this activity are Software Metric Suggester tool that recommends metrics of interest according several software development constraints and based on artificial intelligence and MINT tool that correlates collected measurements and provides near real-time recommendations to software development stakeholders (i.e. DevOps team, project manager, human resources manager etc.) to improve the quality of the development process. To illustrate the efficiency of both tools, we created different scenarios on which both approaches are applied. Results show that both tools are complementary and can be used to improve the software development process and thus the final software quality."
Software effort estimation modeling and fully connected artificial neural network optimization using soft computing techniques,Cluster Computing,,,,10.1007/s10586-023-03979-y,Sofian KassaymehMohammed AlweshahMohammed Azmi Al-BetarAbdelaziz I. HammouriMohammad Atwah Al-Ma’aitah,2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-023-03979-y,Article,"In software engineering, the planning and budgeting stages of a software project are of great importance to all stakeholders, including project managers as well as clients. The estimated costs and scheduling time needed to develop any software project before and/or during startup form the basis of a project’s success. The main objective of soft- ware estimation techniques is to determine the actual effort and/or time required for project development. The use of machine learning methods to address the estimation problem has, in general, proven remarkably successful for many engineering problems. In this study, a fully connected neural network (FCNN) model and a metaheuristic, gray wolf optimizer (GWO), called GWO-FC, is proposed to tackle the software development effort estimation (SEE) problem. The GWO is integrated with FCNN to optimize the FCNN parameters in order to enhance the accuracy of the obtained results by improving the FCNN’s ability to explore the parameter search field and avoid falling into local optima. The proposed technique was evaluated utilizing various benchmark SEE datasets. Furthermore, various recent algorithms from the literature were employed to verify the GWO-FC performance. In terms of accuracy, comparative outcomes reveal that the GWO-FC performs better than other methods in most datasets and evaluation criteria. Experimental outcomes reveal the strong potential of the GWO-FC method to achieve reliable estimation results."
Integration of Work and Study in Computer Science,Cross Reality and Data Science in Engineering,,,,10.1007/978-3-030-52575-0_66,Robert Pucher,2021,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-52575-0_66,Conference paper,"Universities of Applied Sciences in Austria offer study courses especially designed and optimized for today needs of companies and students. During the last 20 years, several approaches have been worked out. Feedback of companies employing graduates and feedback of students are among the main driving factors in the process of optimizing these study programs. An important need of adaption of study programs arises from the preferences of students [ 1 ]. Today almost all students of computer science start to work in their field while still studying. In many cases, this comes from the fact that companies are intensively trying to attract students, as the labor market in the IT field increasingly demands personnel. This in turn leads to many dropouts of students who are not going to finish their studies. One approach to overcome this problem is to integrate the education experienced while working in companies with the education of students in computer science. At the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien, such a program started on the bachelor level in computer science [ 2 ]. In the present paper, the authors describe a program on the master’s level in software engineering, which is scheduled to be introduced in fall 2021."

The central problem was that companies using traditional methods for recruiting remote specialists were missing good candidates because the skilled employees may not be looking for a job yet they may be receptive to an offer. The auxiliary problem was too much data on the internet for human resources management (HRM) staff to make sense of to find the best-fitting candidate. Thus, the research question was: could NLP AI identify good candidates for ERP remote specialist jobs using internet real-time big data? Job criteria were developed using machine learning to identify key skills from existing staff in a case study company. The skills were transformed into ERP remote specialists hiring criteria. The NLP AI software was activated to find the best candidate. The HRM staff at the case study company evaluated the effectiveness of the candidate selected by the NLP AI. The case study company set 70% as the acceptable mean evaluation score. ANOVA was used to determine if HRM staff agreed about their evaluation scores. A Z-test was used to determine if the NLP AI was faster than the mean time needed for HRM to select ERP candidates. The results were that the NLP AI outperformed the humans by a factor of almost 8 h. All HRM staff agreed that the NLP AI was effective in selecting a candidate to match the hiring criteria. The proposed approach might facilitate the research and development of big data, data analytics, NLP AI, and HRM process improvement."

This paper investigates the execution of transnationally required DPGs via empirical evidence from Sri Lanka and other Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) that utilized the DHIS2, a reputed DPG for managing information and associated digital health solutions during the pandemic. The research employs a socio-technical framework to identify four critical factors for fostering resilience: agile governance and development, in-country capacity, transnationally mandated networks of support, and flexible, free, and open-source platforms. The paper details processes that establish resilience, such as adaptive decision-making, collaborative implementation frameworks, and iterative system development. Notwithstanding these facilitators, governance inefficiencies, resource limitations, and technology constraints persist as substantial obstacles to the enduring viability of DPG deployments. The results indicate that attaining resilience in digital public goods requires a multifaceted approach, including governance frameworks, stakeholder collaborations, and adaptable technologies to maintain digital health ecosystems beyond crisis responses. This work enhances information systems research by broadening empirical understanding of digital resilience and providing practical recommendations for policymakers, global health organizations, and digital health practitioners aiming to institutionalize robust DPG-based solutions."

To cope with this challenge, we present a novel framework for software effort estimation, which takes an incremental approach on one hand, using a case-based reasoning (CBR) model, while considering a comprehensive set of different types of requirements models on the other hand, including functional requirements (FRs), non-functional requirements (NFRs), and domain properties (DPs). Concerning the use of CBR, this framework offers a multi-criteria technique for enhancing the accuracy of similarity measures among cases of multiple past projects that are similar to the current software project, towards determining and selecting the most similar one. We have tested our proposed framework on 36 (students’) projects and the results are very encouraging, in the sense that the difference between the estimated effort and the actual effort was lower than 10% in most cases."
How can green building development promote carbon emission reduction efficiency of the construction industry?——Based on the dual perspective of industry and space,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,,10.1007/s11356-021-16380-2,Bin LiaoLin Li,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-021-16380-2,Article,"Green building development(GBD) plays an important role in improving carbon emission reduction efficiency of the construction industry(CEEOCI), and accelerating the construction industry to achieve carbon neutrality goals. In this paper, for the first time, the topic of “green building development promotes carbon neutrality in the construction industry” is included in the crossover research category of industrial economics and space economics. A framework for the analysis of the impact mechanism of GBD and CEEOCI under the dual perspective of “industry-space” is proposed. Based on China’s provincial panel data from 2008 to 2019, using the intermediary adjustment model and the spatial Dubin model to analyze and test the industrial mechanism, spatial mechanism, and spatial effect attenuation boundary of the GBD effect on CEEOCI. The results show GBD is found to promote CEEOCI, and both the GBD and CEEOCI have a clear “center-periphery” spatial pattern. Meanwhile, the impact of GBD on CEEOCI has a “industry-space” two-dimensional mechanism. From an industrial perspective, GBD can change the supply-demand relationship of the construction market by promoting the greening of supporting industries in the construction industry and stimulating green consumption in the market, and ultimately achieve the overall improvement of CEEOCI. From a spatial perspective, GBD can form a new sectoral growth pole and provide elemental support for the improvement of CEEOCI through the polarization effect, but the polarization effect is higher in the range of 1000 km, while attenuation occurs outside the range of 1000 km. This paper provides not only a scientific and effective medium and macro analysis framework for green building development emission reduction performance evaluation but also a new theoretical basis and policy direction for the construction industry to improve carbon reduction efficiency and achieve industrial carbon neutrality."
Impact of Dynamic Metrics on Maintainability of System Using Fuzzy Logic Approach,Congress on Intelligent Systems,,,,10.1007/978-981-33-6981-8_63,ManjuPradeep Kumar Bhatia,2021,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-6981-8_63,Conference paper,"In software development life cycle, software maintainability is the most important and crucial phase as it requires more effort as compared to other phases. To minimize the cost of software maintenance, it is necessary to predict software maintainability during the early phases of software development life cycle. Most of the metrics available in existing literature to calculate maintainability factor were static, i.e., based on design patterns. Therefore, in this paper, authors propose a fuzzy logic model to measure maintainability of software that takes static and dynamic metrics set as input and maintainability as output. Static metrics were collected using CodeMR tool, i.e., an eclipse plugin whereas dynamic event tracing was done by AspectJ, an implementation of aspect oriented programming on an eclipse platform. Further, the proposed fuzzy model was applied on 15 java classes to calculate maintainability at compile time and run time based on static and dynamic metrics. Lastly, proposed model was validated using analytical hierarchy processing (AHP) technique and it is concluded that proposed fuzzy model gives satisfactory result in case of dynamic metrics. Hence, it is concluded that dynamic metrics are better predictor of maintainability factor as compared to static metrics that helps the software industry to measure maintainability of software early in advance."

Salp Swarm Optimizer for Modeling Software Reliability Prediction Problems,Neural Processing Letters,,,,10.1007/s11063-021-10607-6,Sofian KassaymehSalwani AbdullahMohamad Al-LahamMohammed AlweshahMohammed Azmi Al-BetarZalinda Othman,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11063-021-10607-6,Article,"In this paper, software effort prediction (SEP) and software test prediction (STP) (i.e., software reliability problems) are tackled by integrating the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) with a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). Software effort and test prediction problems are common in software engineering and arise when seeking to determine the actual software resources needed to develop a project. BPNN is the most popular prediction algorithm used in the literature. The performance of BPNN depends totally on the initial parameter values such as weight and biases. The main objective of this paper is to integrate SSA with the BPNN to find the optimal weight for every training cycle and thereby improve prediction accuracy. The proposed method, abbreviated as SSA-BPNN, is tested on twelve SEP datasets and two STP datasets. All datasets vary in terms of complexity and size. The results obtained by SSA-BPNN are evaluated according to twelve performance measures: MSE, RMSE, RAE, RRSE, MAE, MRE, MMRE, MdMRE, VAF(%), R2(%), ED, and MD. First, the results obtained by BPNN with SSA (i.e., SSA-BPNN) and without SSA are compared. The evaluation of the results indicates that SSA-BPNN performs better than BPNN for all datasets. In the comparative evaluation, the results of SSA-BPNN are compared against thirteen state-of-the-art methods using the same SEP and STP problem datasets. The evaluation of the results reveals that the proposed method outperforms the comparative methods for almost all datasets, both SEP and STP, in the case of most performance measures. In conclusion, integrating SSA with BPNN is a very powerful approach for solving software reliability problems that can be used widely to yield accurate prediction results."

The prediction of software maintainability has emerged as an important research topic to address industry expectations for reducing costs, in particular, maintenance costs. Researchers and practitioners have been working on proposing and identifying a variety of techniques ranging from statistical to machine learning (ML) for better prediction of software maintainability. This review has been carried out to analyze the empirical evidence on the accuracy of software product maintainability prediction (SPMP) using ML techniques. This paper analyzes and discusses the findings of 77 selected studies published from 2000 to 2018 according to the following criteria: maintainability prediction techniques, validation methods, accuracy criteria, overall accuracy of ML techniques, and the techniques offering the best performance. The review process followed the well-known systematic review process. The results show that ML techniques are frequently used in predicting maintainability. In particular, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine/regression (SVM/R), regression & decision trees (DT), and fuzzy & neuro fuzzy (FNF) techniques are more accurate in terms of PRED and MMRE. The N-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation methods, and the MMRE and PRED accuracy criteria are frequently used in empirical studies. In general, ML techniques outperformed non-machine learning techniques, e.g., regression analysis (RA) techniques, while FNF outperformed SVM/R, DT, and ANN in most experiments. However, while many techniques were reported superior, no specific one can be identified as the best."

Some of these benefits include improved teamwork, improved time to market, and a noticeable decrease in software defects. The primary objective of this paper is to test nineteen research hypotheses that require a quantitative analysis of the Scrum framework. In order to test these hypotheses, the findings of a survey questionnaire was used to gather response data from Scrum practitioners on their perceptions of factors affecting Scrum adoption. Exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach’s alpha analysis confirmed the validity and reliability of the measuring instrument. Following these analyses, a correlation matrix was used to test the relationship strength among the different factors. The Spearman correlation analysis revealed statistically significant correlations. Multiple linear regression statistical models were developed to examine the existence of factors and constructs impacting Scrum adoption. Our findings indicate that four of the nineteen hypotheses are statistically significant. The factors Change Resistance, Sprint Management, Relative Advantage, and Complexity are shown to have a significant linear relationship to Scrum as perceived by Scrum Practitioners working within South African organizations. Future research could incorporate a larger population sample to improve the generalizability of the findings."

Der Artikel geht dieser Frage nach und fokussiert die Rolle des Anthropomorphismus von Technologie diesbezüglich. Während bisherige Forschung teilweise widersprüchliche Ergebnisse aufweist, die mit Herausforderungen angewandter Messmethoden von Anthropomorphismus und sozialen Bedürfnissen zusammenhängen könnten, ergänzen wir diese anhand einer qualitativen Interview-Studie ( n  = 8). Ergebnisse unserer Studie unterstützen das Potenzial anthropomorpher Technologien, soziale Nutzerbedürfnisse anzusprechen, und unterstreichen gleichzeitig Unterschiede in der Qualität der Mensch-Technik- und zwischenmenschlichen Interaktion. Darüber hinaus deuten Ergebnisse auf eine Verzerrung durch Effekte sozialer Erwünschtheit hin, zumal Individuen die Erfüllung sozialer Bedürfnisse durch Technologien als lächerlich oder unangemessen zu betrachten scheinen. Gestaltungs- und gesellschaftliche Implikationen werden diskutiert. Praktische Relevanz: Der Artikel erforscht das Potenzial von Technologien, soziale Nutzerbedürfnisse anzusprechen und diskutiert Implikationen für Marketing und Produktgestaltung, z. B., wie Technologien gestaltet sein sollten, um soziale Nutzerbedürfnisse anzusprechen bzw. welche Anwendungskontexte sich anbieten. Ebenso reflektiert der Artikel gesellschaftliche Implikationen, die sich aus dem potenziellen Effekt der Interaktion mit Technik auf soziale Nutzerbedürfnisse ergeben. As interactive technologies, such as chatbots or voice assistants, increasingly become social counterparts and resemble human interaction partners in many ways, the question arises whether they are also able to address users’ social needs. This paper explores whether interaction with technology can address social needs and what role technology anthropomorphism plays in this. While previous research shows somewhat contradictory results potentially related to challenges of applied assessment methods of anthropomorphism and social needs, we complement this by means of a qualitative interview study ( n  = 8). Our study findings support a potential of anthropomorphic technology to address users’ social needs but also highlight differences between the quality of human-technology and interpersonal interaction. In addition, our findings hint at a social desirability bias, since people see social need fulfillment through technology as silly or inappropriate. Design and societal implications are discussed. Practical Relevance: This article explores the potential of technology to address users’ social needs and discusses practical implications for marketing and design, e.g., how technologies should be designed in order to affect users’ social needs and which contexts of application might be suitable. Moreover, the article also reflects on societal implications resulting from a potential effect of interaction with technology on users’ social needs."
Collaborative process tailoring in evolutionary software development: a teamwork-quality perspective,Software Quality Journal,,,,10.1007/s11219-022-09597-y,Chung-Yang ChenPing-Yu HsuHong-Ngoc Vu,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-022-09597-y,Article,"This study highlighted the importance of software process tailoring (SPT) in modern software projects characterized by dynamic and evolutionary development. SPT is a collaborative practice, and the existing literature has focused on team-based knowledge aspects in performing SPT, whereas the quality of team interactions has rarely been discussed to address its conflictual nature. This study examined the teamwork quality (TWQ) framework with two team behavioral factors, namely team reflexivity and member autonomy, and developed a research model to explore how TWQ fits in the SPT’s conflicting context and how autonomy and reflexivity affect TWQ to promote SPT. The results showed that TWQ is essential for dealing with challenging tasks in SPT. The results also supported the evidence that reflexivity positively affects TWQ while member autonomy harms TWQ. When examining the mediating effect to see how TWQ operationalizes as an intermediate in the relationship between the two factors and SPT performance, this study found that reflexivity directly and indirectly boosts SPT performance. Member autonomy and SPT performance are independent when TWQ is the mediator. However, without TWQ, member autonomy negatively impacts SPT effectiveness and efficiency."

Keyword-labeled self-admitted technical debt and static code analysis have significant relationship but limited overlap,Software Quality Journal,,,,10.1007/s11219-023-09655-z,Leevi RantalaMika MäntyläValentina Lenarduzzi,2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-023-09655-z,Article,"Technical debt presents sub-optimal choices made in development, which are beneficial in the short term but not in the long run. Consciously admitted debt, which is marked with a keyword, e.g., TODO, is called keyword-labeled self-admitted technical debt (KL-SATD). KL-SATD can lead to adverse effects in software development, e.g., to a rise in complexity within the developed software. We investigated the relationship between KL-SATD from source code comments and reports from the highly popular industrial program analysis tool SonarQube. The goal was to find which SonarQube metrics and issues are related to KL-SATD introduction and removal and how many KL-SATD in the context of an issue addresses that issue. We performed a study with 33 software repositories. We analyzed the changes in SonarQube reports (sqale index, reliability and security remediation metrics, and SonarQube issues) and the relationship to KL-SATD addition and removal with mixed model analysis. We manually annotated a sample to investigate how many KL-SATD comments are in the context of SonarQube issues and how many address them directly. KL-SATD is associated with a reduction in code maintainability measured with SonarQube’s sqale index. KL-SATD removal is associated with an increase in code maintainability (sqale index) and reliability measured with SonarQube’s reliability remediation effort. The introduction and removal of KL-SATD have a predominantly relationship with code smells, and not with vulnerabilities and bugs. Manual annotation revealed that 36% of KL-SATD comments are in the context of a SonarQube issue, but only 15% of the comment address an issue. This means that despite of statistical relationship between KL-SATD comments and SonarQube reports there is a large set of KL-SATD comments that are in areas that Sonarqube reports as clean or free of maintainability issues. KL-SATD introduction and removal are connected mainly to code smells, connecting them to maintainability rather than reliability or security. This is reinforced by the relationship with the sqale index, as well as the dominance of code smells in SonarQube issues. Many KL-SATD issues have characteristics going beyond static analysis tools and require future studies extending the capabilities of the current tools. As KL-SATD comments and SonarQube reports appear to have limited overlap, it suggests that they are complementary and both are needed for getting a comprehensive view coverage of code maintainability. The study also presents rules violations developers should be aware of regarding KL-SATD introduction and removal."

However, advances in pedagogical methods, changes in the skills of high-school graduates, and widening online options in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic brought on a new set of expectations. This situation may be considered an opportunity to address the threat of potentially increasing mismatch and misalignment between competences required by the IS industry labour market and current training contents offered and methods used by higher education institutions. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the challenges BIS programs have to face and address. It considers everyday experiences of BIS educators and current best practices as starting point. Then provides an overview of employer and alumni opinion, as well as reviews up-to-date teaching methods related to teaching soft computer skills. It also considers the requirements and opportunities related to an increasingly online-centred situation. Based on these challenges the paper lays down the foundation for a potential curriculum design approach intended to address all of the above issues in an integrated framework."

However, existing CPDP methods usually assume that source and target projects have the same metrics. Heterogeneous defect prediction (HDP) is proposed and has attracted increasing attention, which refers to the metric sets from source and target projects are different in CPDP. HDP conducts prediction model using the instances with heterogeneous metrics from external projects and then use this model to predict defect-prone software instances in source project. However, building HDP methods is challenging including the distribution difference between source and target projects with heterogeneous metrics. In this paper, we propose a D eep adversarial learning based HDP (DHDP) approach. DHDP leverages deep neural network to learn nonlinear transformation for each project to obtain common feature represent, which the heterogeneous data from different projects can be compared directly. DHDP consists of two parts: a discriminator and a classifier that compete with each other. A classifier tries to minimize the similarity across classes and maximize the inter-class similarity. A discriminator tries to distinguish the source of instances that is source or target project on the common feature space. Expensive experiments are performed on 10 public projects from two datasets in terms of F-measure and G-measure. The experimental results show that DHDP gains superior prediction performance improvement compared to a range of competing methods."

Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of the construction industry, more than one task is required to be performed at the same time. If safety planning is improper, it may lead to serious accidents on-site, directly affecting overall productivity. Recent technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM) have the potential to manage safety on the construction site. This study deals with the status check of the awareness of BIM in Indian construction along with benefits, barriers faced in Indian construction. This study also presents the benefits that BIM implementation can bring for safety management. In this study, a questionnaire was designed to ascertain the level of awareness of BIM in the Indian construction industry. The questionnaire was distributed to construction professionals from all over India. A total of 171 valid responses were received from all the corners of India. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences analysis (SPSS) has been used for data analysis. The survey concludes that the Indian construction sector needs to work on the three main aspects that include awareness of BIM and its benefits for organizations, accumulation of BIM in the tertiary education system, and delivering corporate training in construction organizations for a successful realization of benefits by the implementation of BIM."

However, little effort has been made to determine the role of requirements management in DevOps. The objective of this study is to help both researchers and practitioners by providing an overview of the best practices regarding requirements engineering in DevOps and identifying which areas still need to be investigated. A multivocal mapping study has, therefore, been carried out in order to study which methodologies, techniques and tools are used to support requirements management in DevOps environments. After applying the review protocol, 37 papers from formal literature and 14 references from grey literature were selected for analysis. The general conclusions obtained after analysing these papers were that, within DevOps, more attention should be paid to: (1) the reuse of requirements in order to identify systems and software artefacts that can serve as a basis for the specification of new projects; (2) the communication of requirements between the different areas of an organisation and the stakeholders of a project; (3) the traceability of requirements in order to identify the relationship with other requirements, artefacts, tasks and processes; (4) non-functional requirements in order to identify the requirements of the operations area in the early phases of a project; and finally (5) specific requirements tools that should be seamlessly integrated into the DevOps toolchain. All these issues must be considered without ignoring the agile and continuous practices of development, operations and business teams. More effort must also be made to validate new methodologies in industry so as to assess and determine their strengths and weaknesses."
Motivating members’ involvement to effectually conduct collaborative software process tailoring,Empirical Software Engineering,,,,10.1007/s10664-022-10225-3,Jung-Chieh LeeChung-Yang Chen,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-022-10225-3,Article,"Contemporary business and software environments are highly competitive and rapidly evolving, resulting in software projects that are highly customized and changeable during development. Therefore, software process tailoring (SPT) is important as software teams conduct SPT to adjust shared development processes and evolve the project to better meet unique and dynamic needs. SPT is a special type of teamwork in which members’ active participation and critical input are necessary for understanding and synthesizing various business and technical concerns that may be divergent and conflictual and then jointly identifying an integrated tailoring solution. In this context, this study examines members’ decisive and critical involvement in SPT and adopts a motivational perspective to explore how motivation can facilitate SPT performance. Specifically, we use empowerment theory to develop a model to theorize and examine how psychological empowerment (PE) in terms of meaningfulness, autonomy, potency, and impact motivates software teams to efficiently and effectively conduct SPT. The model also considers the power distance (PD) to understand how it functions in team-based critical thinking and decisional processes to energize team members’ participative effort. The investigation surveyed 102 software development teams and used partial least squares (PLS) to analyze the data. The results show that PE in terms of the four components has various influences on SPT performance and that PD has nonsignificant moderating effects. This study contributes to the software engineering literature by uncovering the contextual mechanism underlying the relationship between PE and PD in SPT. The limitations and possible extensions of this study are also outlined for future research."
Applying statistical approach to check the consistency of pairwise comparison matrices during software requirements prioritization process,International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management,,,,10.1007/s13198-021-01090-2,Mohd. SadiqMohd. SadimAzra Parveen,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13198-021-01090-2,Article,"In the field of software engineering, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have been applied during software requirements prioritization (SRP) process. Among various MCDM methods, analytic hierarchy process is a desired technique to compute the ranking values of the software requirements (SRs). These ranking values are employed to choose the SRs that would be executed during different releases of the software. During SRP, stakeholders specify their preferences on SRs in a matrix, which is known as pairwise comparison matrix (PCM). This matrix is used to compute the ranking values of the SRs. The ranking values of the SRs would be reliable only when the PCMs are consistent. Based on our literature review, we identify that during SRP process less attention is given to statistical based approaches to examine the consistency of PCM. Therefore, to address this issue we proposed a method for SRP which is pliable and genuine because it sets a relevant significance level according to the size of the PCMs. Finally, the proposed method is discussed by considering the SRs of an institute examination system."
Agility as a Driver of Digital Transformation - a Literature Review,The Role of Digital Technologies in Shaping the Post-Pandemic World,,,,10.1007/978-3-031-15342-6_19,Inga F. Schlömer,2022,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-15342-6_19,Conference paper,"Agility has become increasingly relevant in research and practice in recent years. Originating from software development, it is now progressively applied beyond this field. This agile scaling enables companies to harness the benefits of a flexible and rapid response to change. Widespread digitalisation, increasing complexity and dynamic competitive conditions require companies to demonstrate flexibility and speed of response to drive a digital transformation (DT) towards a digital business. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies have been confronted with DT. Against this background, this paper aims to derive from previous research how companies can benefit from agile project management and agile scaling in DT. For this purpose, a structured literature review was conducted on four scholarly databases, 225 articles were found and reduced to 28 relevant articles through a methodical approach. The review revealed that agility is defined as a driver of DT. Starting from agile digitalisation projects, agility can be carried into the organization and thus support DT. Nevertheless, while the connections between pandemic and DT and between agility and DT are already the subject of research, the two fields have not been linked in the analysed articles. The findings synthesize the current state of knowledge and suggest first agile approaches to framing DT in the context of the pandemic. Future research efforts are needed to provide companies with measures for dealing with the “new normal”."

It can help the reviewers sort the pull request queue, remind developers about the review processing time, speed up the review process and accelerate software development. There is a lack of work that systematically organizes the factors that affect pull request latency. Also, there is no related work discussing the differences and variations in characteristics in different scenarios and contexts. In this paper, we collected relevant factors through a literature review approach. Then we assessed their relative importance in five scenarios and six different contexts using the mixed-effects linear regression model. The most important factors differ in different scenarios. The length of the description is most important when pull requests are submitted. The existence of comments is most important when closing pull requests, using CI tools, and when the contributor and the integrator are different. When there exist comments, the latency of the first comment is the most important. Meanwhile, the influence of factors may change in different contexts. For example, the number of commits in a pull request has a more significant impact on pull request latency when closing than submitting due to changes in contributions brought about by the review process. Both human and bot comments are positively correlated with pull request latency. In contrast, the bot’s first comments are more strongly correlated with latency, but the number of comments is less correlated. Future research and tool implementation needs to consider the impact of different contexts. Researchers can conduct related studies based on our publicly available datasets and replication scripts."

Since it is an iterative and incremental methodology, the software is developed in releases. For each release, the software development team and the customer agree upon a development plan. However, the context of the software project may change due to unpredicted circumstances that generally arise, for example, new software requirements or changes in the development team. Consequently, these factors force the release plan to be adjusted. When the release plan is modified, it is necessary to consider at least four criteria to minimize the economic and operational impact of these changes. Therefore, this activity can be analyzed as a multi-objective problem. In the last three decades, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have become an effective and efficient tool to solve multi-objective problems. In this paper, we evaluate three multi-objective optimization approaches when solving the release plan rescheduling problem. Mainly, we focus our investigation on analyzing the conflict between the considered objectives and on the performance of the Pareto-based, the indicator-based, and the decomposition-based multi-objective optimization approaches."

The popularity of research regarding the application of risk management in software projects has been consistently growing in recent years, especially with the application of machine learning techniques to help identify risk levels of risk factors of a project before its development begins, with the goal of improving the likelihood of success of these projects. This paper presents the results of the application of machine learning techniques for risk assessment in software projects. A Python application was developed and, using Scikit-learn, two machine learning models, trained using software project risk data shared by a partner company of this project, were created to predict risk impact and likelihood levels on a scale of 1 to 3. Different algorithms were tested to compare the results obtained by high performance but non-interpretable algorithms ( e.g. , Support Vector Machine) and the ones obtained by interpretable algorithms ( e.g. , Random Forest), whose performance tends to be lower than their non-interpretable counterparts. The results showed that Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes were the best performing algorithms. Support Vector Machine had an accuracy of 69% in predicting impact levels, and Naive Bayes had an accuracy of 63% in predicting likelihood levels, but the results presented in other evaluation metrics ( e.g. , AUC, Precision) show the potential of the approach presented in this use case."

The coordination of teams has been identified as one of the main challenges. This study presents a rich longitudinal explanatory case study of a very large software development programme with 10 development teams. We focus on inter-team coordination in two phases: one that applies a first-generation agile development method and another that uses a second-generation one. We identified 27 coordination mechanisms in the first phase, and 14 coordination mechanisms in the second. Based on an analysis of coordination strategies and mechanisms, we develop five propositions on how the transition from a first- to a second-generation method impacts coordination. These propositions have implications for theory and practice."

However, bias can lead to low model performance and misguided business decisions, resulting in fatal financial, social, and reputational impacts. This framework provides an overview of potential biases and corresponding mitigation methods for each phase of the well-established process model CRISP-DM. Eight distinct types of biases and 25 mitigation methods were identified through a literature review and allocated to six phases of the reference model in a synthesized way. Furthermore, some biases are mitigated in different phases as they occur. Our framework helps to create clarity in these multiple relationships, thus assisting project managers in avoiding biased ML-outcomes."
Identification of Critical Factors for Construction Megaprojects Success (CMS),"Collaboration and Integration in Construction, Engineering, Management and Technology",,,,10.1007/978-3-030-48465-1_14,Ting WangAlbert P. C. ChanQinghua He,2021,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-48465-1_14,Conference paper,"The worldwide growth of construction megaprojects has triggered an increasing number of academic publications in the past few decades. Therefore, this paper aims to systematically review studies on the critical success factors (CSFs) to identify the CSFs for construction megaprojects from academic journals between 2000 and 2018. The research results indicated an increasing research interest in the investigation of critical factors for CMS since 2000. Meanwhile, based on the number of 27 journal articles, a total of 33 CSFs were identified eventually and the top five were adequate resource availability, partnering/relationships with key stakeholders, adequate communication and coordination among related parties, public support or acceptance, and clear strategic vision. A checklist of CSFs for CMS was developed and could render new insight for researchers and practitioners to conduct further studies and enhance megaproject management in practice. Moreover, the results would also enrich the theory of megaproject management."
Integrating Fuzzy Logic Technique in Case-Based Reasoning for Improving the Inspection Quality of Software Requirements Specifications,Applied Computing to Support Industry: Innovation and Technology,,,,10.1007/978-3-030-38752-5_39,Salama A. MostafaSaraswathy Shamini GunasekaranShihab Hamad Khaleefah,2020,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-38752-5_39,Conference paper,"The development success of software is essentially based on the quality of its Software Requirements Specifications (SRS). A requirement represents the main objective that needs to be accomplished, while a specification is a full description of this objective. The inspection of the Software Requirements Specification (iSRS) system is developed to ensure that the SRSs are of high quality. This paper presents the contribution of integrating a fuzzy logic technique in the Case Base Reasoning (CBR) as a reasoning framework in the iSRS system. The fuzzy logic technique provides a disambiguation mechanism within the Retrieve, Reuse, Revise, and Retain steps of the CBR cycle. Specifically, it is used as a similarity measurement technique in the matching process between the inspected SRS cases and the existing SRS cases in the CBR case base. It then classifies and labels the cases in the case base to no-match, partial-match and, complete-match cases. This classification improves the overall reasoning and inspection of the SRS quality by comparing the inspected case with the most similar cases of the case base."
Software Quality Assurance in INDIGO-DataCloud Project: a Converging Evolution of Software Engineering Practices to Support European Research e-Infrastructures,Journal of Grid Computing,,,,10.1007/s10723-020-09509-z,Pablo Orviz FernándezMário DavidDoina Cristina DumaElisabetta RonchieriJorge GomesDavide Salomoni,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10723-020-09509-z,Article,"From the advent of Grid technology – as the new paradigm of distributed computing – to the current days of Cloud computing models, the continuous need of new tools and services to match the scientific community requirements has been addressed in Europe through dedicated software development projects for e–Infrastructure creation, operation and management. This work presents the most significant software quality breakthroughs obtained in one of such projects, INDIGO–DataCloud , the main challenges and barriers confronted throughout the lifespan of the project, and how they were partially or totally overcome. The knowledge base established throughout the last 15 years of diverse software development initiatives in Europe for sustaining distributed research e-Infrastructures, supported by the advances in the area of software engineering, definitely contributed to improve the quality and reliability of the software delivered, and consequently, the operational stability of the European e–Infrastructures. INDIGO–DataCloud project is a good evidence of such insights, where, unlike the preceding trend found in past projects, the enforcement of Software Quality Assurance practices has been present since the very early stages of the software lifecycle."
A novel Pythagorean fuzzy PERT approach to measure criticality with multi-criteria in project management problems,Granular Computing,,,,10.1007/s41066-024-00461-x,Muhammad AkramAmna Habib,2024,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41066-024-00461-x,Article,"In this research article, the credibility distribution is defined as a Pythagorean fuzzy restriction, which serves as an elastic constraint on the possible input states of a variable. This definition relates the credibility theory to the theory of Pythagorean fuzzy sets. The current study first defines Cauchy Pythagorean fuzzy numbers and offers a novel method for precise and analytic determination of the inverse credibility distribution. Examples with various degrees of credibility are shown numerically and graphically. Afterwards, we focus on the identification of critical paths in project networks. For this purpose, Pythagorean fuzzy Logic and Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methodologies are combined in a novel structure that is provided to expand the applications of the project scheduling systems. The development of the Pythagorean Fuzzy Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PFPERT), however, was motivated by the vagueness of the time and cost parameters. The primary objective is to find the critical route while considering some decision criteria such as length, duration, cost, resources, and risk factors. All of the criteria are evaluated mathematically based on Pythagorean fuzzy logic and integrated using the VIKOR approach to obtain the resulting critical route. To further clarify the potentials and capabilities of the suggested strategy, the proposed algorithm is successfully examined for a case study related to a greenhouse construction project."
Supervision of master theses based on Scrum: A case study,Education and Information Technologies,,,,10.1007/s10639-021-10433-2,Gonçalo TomásMiguel Mira da SilvaJosé Bidarra,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-021-10433-2,Article,"The success rate of a master program on Information Systems and Computer Engineering (MEIC) in a Portuguese university is very unsatisfactory, showing that less than half of the students complete the assigned work in their first term. However, the success rate of a group of students that were supervised based on the Scrum framework was much higher. So, in this study we assess the current situation and identify the benefits of using Scrum to manage master’s theses. Evidence suggests that this approach increases the number of students successfully completing their projects. So, this paper discusses the issues at stake and reports on a qualitative study with focus on the actual practices and benefits reported by students in the master program. We found that some methods in the Scrum framework can address existing problems in the development of theses with very positive results."
Risk factors in software development projects: a systematic literature review,Software Quality Journal,,,,10.1007/s11219-018-9427-5,Júlio Menezes JrCristine GusmãoHermano Moura,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-018-9427-5,Article,"Risks are an inherent part of any software project. The presence of risks in environments of software development projects requires the perception so that the associated factors do not lead projects to failure. The correct identification and monitoring of these factors can be decisive for the success of software development projects and software quality. However, in practice, risk management in software development projects is still often neglected and one of the reasons is due to the lack of knowledge of risk factors that promoted a low perception of them in the environment. This paper aims to identify and to map risk factors in environments of software development projects. We conducted a systematic literature review through a database search, as well as we performed an assessment of quality of the selected studies. All this process was conducted through a research protocol. We identified 41 studies. In these works, we extracted and classified risk factors according to the software development taxonomy developed by Software Engineering Institute (SEI). In total, 148 different risk factors were categorized. The found evidences suggest that risk factors relating to software requirements are the most recurrent and cited. In addition, we highlight that the most mentioned risk factors were the lack of technical skills by the staff. Therefore, the results converged to the need for more studies on these factors as fundamental items for reduction of failure level of a software development project."
Temporal resonant graph network for representation learning on dynamic graphs,Applied Intelligence,,,,10.1007/s10489-022-03919-0,Zidu YinKun Yue,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-022-03919-0,Article,"Generating dynamic node representation via limited samples at a time is a challenging task. Meanwhile, the human brain can quickly capture dynamic features without much information in a changing environment. Motivated by the idea of brain functions from the adaptive resonance theory (ART), in this paper, we designed and built a dynamic model for node representation generation. Based on the data flow of the ART model, we replaced the classic ART components with deep learnable modules. Our proposed method is suitable for capturing different graph evolution events even with very sparse changes. Experimental results on several synthetic and real-world dynamic graphs for many vital applications show the superiority of our proposed method."

Several software development effort estimation (SDEE) models have been proposed in the literature including machine learning techniques. However, none of these models proved to be powerful in all situation and their performance varies from one dataset to another. To overcome the weaknesses of single estimation techniques, the ensemble methods have been recently employed and evaluated in SDEE. In this paper, we have developed an ensemble of optimal trees for software development effort estimation. We have conducted an empirical study to evaluate and compare the performance of this optimal trees ensemble using five popular datasets and the 30% hold-out validation method. The results show that the proposed ensemble outperforms regression trees and random forest models in terms of MMRE, MdMRE and Pred(0.25) in all datasets used in this paper."

Since its development by Zhao et al. (Neural Comput Appl 32:9777–9808, 2020; Eng Appl Artif Intell 87:103300, 2020), the MRFO algorithm has garnered significant attention among researchers and has been applied across various fields to solve real-world optimization problems. This is due to its simple structure, flexibility, ease of implementation, and reasonable convergence rate. This paper provides an extensive and in-depth survey of the MRFO algorithm including modification, multi-objective, and hybridized versions. It also examines the various applications of the MRFO algorithm in several domains of problems such as classification, feature selection, scheduling, robotics, photovoltaic power systems, optimal parameter control, and clustering. Furthermore, the results of the MRFO algorithm are compared with some well-regarded optimization meta-heuristics such as Differential Evolution (DE), Harmony Search (HS), Bat Algorithm (BA), Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), Moth Flame Optimization (MFO), Henry Gas Solubility Optimization (HGSO), and White Shark Optimizer (WSO). Finally, the paper proposes some potential future research directions to further advance the MRFO’s capability and applicability."
Data-driven effort estimation techniques of agile user stories: a systematic literature review,Artificial Intelligence Review,,,,10.1007/s10462-021-10132-x,Bashaer AlsaadiKawther Saeedi,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10462-021-10132-x,Article,"At an early stage in the development process, a development team must obtain insight into the software being developed to establish a reliable plan. Thus, the team members should investigate, in depth, any information relating to the development. A major challenge for developers is software development effort estimation (SDEE), which refers to gauging the amount of effort needed to develop the software. In agile methodologies, a project is delivered in iterations, each of which delivers a set of requirements known as user stories. Therefore, SDEE in agile focuses on estimating a single user story’s effort, not the project as a whole, as in traditional development. Among the various techniques, data-driven methods have proved effective in effort estimation, as they are unaffected by external pressure from managers. Moreover, no experts have to be available at the point when estimation is undertaken. By conducting a systematic literature review, this study presents a comprehensive overview of data-driven techniques for user story effort estimation. The results show that there has been limited work on this topic. Studies were analysed to address questions covering five main points: technique; performance evaluation method; accuracy, independent factors (effort drivers); and the characteristics of the datasets. The main performance evaluation methods are performance measures, baseline benchmarks, statistical tests, distribution of estimates, comparison against similar existing techniques and human estimation. Four types of independent factors were identified: personnel; product; process; and estimation. Furthermore, the story point was found to be the most frequently used effort metric in agile user stories."
Role-Playing Computer Ethics: Designing and Evaluating the Privacy by Design (PbD) Simulation,Science and Engineering Ethics,,,,10.1007/s11948-020-00250-0,Katie ShiltonDonal HeidenbladAdam PorterSusan WinterMary Kendig,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-020-00250-0,Article,"There is growing consensus that teaching computer ethics is important, but there is little consensus on how to do so. One unmet challenge is increasing the capacity of computing students to make decisions about the ethical challenges embedded in their technical work. This paper reports on the design, testing, and evaluation of an educational simulation to meet this challenge. The privacy by design simulation enables more relevant and effective computer ethics education by letting students experience and make decisions about common ethical challenges encountered in real-world work environments. This paper describes the process of incorporating empirical observations of ethical questions in computing into an online simulation and an in-person board game. We employed the Values at Play framework to transform empirical observations of design into a playable educational experience. First, we conducted qualitative research to discover when and how values levers—practices that encourage values discussions during technology development—occur during the design of new mobile applications. We then translated these findings into gameplay elements, including the goals, roles, and elements of surprise incorporated into a simulation. We ran the online simulation in five undergraduate computer and information science classes. Based on this experience, we created a more accessible board game, which we tested in two undergraduate classes and two professional workshops. We evaluated the effectiveness of both the online simulation and the board game using two methods: a pre/post-test of moral sensitivity based on the Defining Issues Test, and a questionnaire evaluating student experience. We found that converting real-world ethical challenges into a playable simulation increased student’s reported interest in ethical issues in technology, and that students identified the role-playing activity as relevant to their technical coursework. This demonstrates that roleplaying can emphasize ethical decision-making as a relevant component of technical work."
Standing on shoulders or feet?

The objective of this study is to examine the usage of data papers published in the MSR proceedings in terms of use frequency, users, and use purpose. Data track papers were collected from the MSR data showcase track and through the manual inspection of older MSR proceedings. The use of data papers was established through manual citation searching followed by reading the citing studies and dividing them into strong and weak citations. Contrary to weak, strong citations truly use the data set of a data paper. Data papers were then manually clustered based on their content, whereas their strong citations were classified by hand according to the knowledge areas of the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge. A survey study on 108 authors and users of data papers provided further insights regarding motivation and effort in data paper production, encouraging and discouraging factors in data set use, and future desired direction regarding data papers. We found that 65% of the data papers have been used in other studies, with a long-tail distribution in the number of strong citations. Weak citations to data papers usually refer to them as an example. MSR data papers are cited in total less than other MSR papers. A considerable number of the strong citations stem from the teams that authored the data papers. Publications providing Version Control System (VCS) primary and derived data are the most frequent data papers and the most often strongly cited ones. Enhanced developer data papers are the least common ones, and the second least frequently strongly cited. Data paper authors tend to gather data in the context of other research. Users of data sets appreciate high data quality and are discouraged by lack of replicability of data set construction. Data related to machine learning or derived from the manufacturing sector are two suggestions of the respondents for future data papers. Overall, data papers have provided the foundation for a significant number of studies, but there is room for improvement in their utilization. This can be done by setting a higher bar for their publication, by encouraging their use, by promoting open science initiatives, and by providing incentives for the enrichment of existing data collections."

This study explores the motivations, experiences and plans of students pursuing a multidisciplinary degree combining majors from the Humanities with Information Systems. This was accomplished through a qualitative, exploratory case study at a South African University. The findings indicate that students are motivated by a broad range of factors including their personal attributes, individuals close to them and the employability/financial prospects of a degree. One of the significant findings in terms of the experiences of students is that students sometimes feel like because their degrees are from the Faculty of Humanities, peers and potential employers in the technology industry doubt their Information Systems related skills. After completing their studies, students have a wide variety of plans such as pursuing Information Systems related careers or starting a business. Some students expressed a desire to make an impactful difference. The outcomes of this study can inform other universities that wish to implement similar degree programmes as well as students looking to pursue such programmes."

Grounding our research in the extant literature, the broader lay discussion, as well as our own qualitative research, we define, conceptualize, and operationalize this construct, which we label as “ invisible family load .” Using a mixed method, five-study approach, we offer a comprehensive, multidimensional definition and provide a nine-item, empirically validated scale to measure its component parts— managerial , cognitive , and emotional family load. In addition, we investigate gender differences and find, as expected, that women report higher levels of each dimension. We also examine the implications of invisible family load for employee health, well-being, and job attitudes, as well as family-to-work spillover. Although we substantiated some significant negative consequences, contrary to the popular view that consequences of invisible family load are uniformly negative, our results show some potential benefits. Even after accounting for conscientiousness and neuroticism, managerial family load related to greater family-work enrichment, and cognitive family load related to greater family satisfaction and job performance. Yet, emotional family load had uniformly negative potential consequences including greater family-to-work conflict, sleep problems, family and job exhaustion, and lower life and family satisfaction. Our research sets the stage for scholars to forge a path forward to enhance understanding of this phenomenon and its implications for individuals, their families, and the organizations for which they work."

This paper takes an industry-specific perspective by analysing the dissemination, objectives and relative popularity of agile frameworks in the German banking sector. The data provides insights into expectations and experiences associated with agile methods and indicates possible implementation hurdles and success factors. Our research provides the first comprehensive analysis of agile methods in the German banking sector. The comparison with a selected number of fintechs has revealed some differences between banks and fintechs. We found that almost all banks and fintechs apply agile methods in IT projects. However, fintechs have relatively more experience with agile methods than banks and use them more intensively. Scrum is the most relevant framework used in practice. Scaled agile frameworks are so far negligible in the German banking sector. Acceleration of projects is apparently the most important objective of deploying agile methods. In addition, agile methods can contribute to cost savings and lead to improved quality and innovation performance, though for banks it is evidently more challenging to reach their respective targets than for fintechs. Overall our findings suggest that German banks are still in a maturing process of becoming more agile and that there is room for an accelerated adoption of agile methods in general and scaled agile frameworks in particular."

Framework for Project Management in Agile Projects: A Quantitative Study,Information Technology for Management: Current Research and Future Directions,,,,10.1007/978-3-030-43353-6_9,Gloria J. Miller,2020,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-43353-6_9,Conference paper,"Recent studies have confirmed the efficacy of agile methodologies in project success, but can projects skip several project management tasks and still deliver the expected results? How are traditional project managers engaged in agile projects? Who executes what project management tasks in projects applying agile methodologies? The aim of this study was to define a framework for project management tasks in agile projects. The results quantify subjective and theoretical speculation on who performs the project management tasks in agile projects. Project managers are engaged in agile projects, and the team, the product owner, and the project sponsor are significantly involved in project management tasks. The agile coach is not a substitute for the project manager. This study identifies areas where agile methodologies should be updated to clarify team responsibilities for project management activities."
Towards Actionable Data Science: Domain Experts as End-Users of Data Science Systems,Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW),,,,10.1007/s10606-023-09475-6,Ju Yeon JungTom SteinbergerChaehan So,2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-023-09475-6,Article,"As a wider range of organizations explore using data science systems, data science research has given growing attention to the role of domain experts. Most of this research still views data science systems as centered on the development of statistical models or algorithms by technical data scientists, with domain experts limited to the role of informers. Our paper turns attention to how domain experts mediate whether data science models or algorithms lead to action through their situated data practices. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and a pilot machine learning project at a craft brewery, we identify situations where the brewers’ data practices led to unreliable, incomplete data, and unpack how such data limited the effectiveness of data science activities. Extending research in CSCW and STS on domain experts’ data practices to the data science context, we aim to inform the design of data science systems that are more actionable for their end-users."

This allows the agile management of complex IT portfolios or development programmes which require methodology which goes beyond the single-project-single-team scope of e.g. the basic Scrum approach. The SAFe methodology claims to be the right approach for lean enterprises. But this still assumes that it is implemented in a single organization with stable organizational setups and team structures and with professional staff. In contrast, we apply SAFe in a typical distributed and loose environment of an Open Source development project. Instead of a dedicated team, the involved staff is organized in an informal, open community of practice (OpenCoP) where participants join and leave and where staff contributes only certain amounts of time with a limited commitment. In addition, we deal with a university led IT programme which involves students as developers with limited experience and competence in professional project work. This paper presents the case study of the development of a Digital Education Ecosystem (DEE) for a Virtual Master School. The members of this Master School (including the students) are the co-developers and the users of the DEE. They form an OpenCoP which develops a customized IT system for their own needs. Applying SAFe in such an environment is new and challenging. This paper describes first experiences in this field."

Processes in software development demonstrate many problems relating to multidisciplinary collaboration. Communication has been recognized as an important factor for success in software development projects because previous researches on stakeholder analysis and collaboration has demonstrated the importance of communication. Hence, this study investigated and analyzed communication between stakeholders in collaborative software development projects with references to team activities as a social and intellectual practice. The objective of the study was to define factors that would influence and recognize the process of collaboration during software development. The study focused on communication between the software developers (Students) and project managers (lecturers) during the software requirements phase, interdisciplinary collaboration, team process, and inter-team, particularly between software engineers and technical communicators. First, a survey questionnaire was developed to gather data and analyze the effects and sources of communication among the involved stakeholders in software development projects. An experimental analysis was also performed to further test the supporting impact of client documents on requirements gathering. An experimental study was conducted to further test the supporting effect on requirement gathering of client documents. The results revealed that project managers are vital to software development progress, because they are the one that will provide the team with documents that support requirements gathering, thus improving team productivity and efficiency. Finally, software teams ensured that participants from all professional backgrounds were actively involved in the projects with a relatively centralized team structure."

Several Agile methodologies previously have worked with Extreme programming (XP). Before improving the process, defect prevention (DP) is inevitable. In addition, DP largely depends on defect detection either found earlier in the design and implementation stages or held in the testing phases. However, testing maturity model integration (TMMI) has a crucial aspect in DP as well as process improvement of the software. In particular, when software gets validated by being tested and fixed the defects up, it achieves the maximum capability maturity model integration (CMMI) aiming the process improvement. Here, the article has proposed an improved defect detection and prevention model to enhance the software process following the approach of XP. Besides, as a unique contribution, we have united the capability and testing model integration to ensure better SPI."

In contrast to other process automation technologies, robotic process automation is lightweight and only accesses the presentation layer of IT systems to mimic human behavior. Due to the novelty of robotic process automation and the varying approaches when implementing the technology, there are reports that up to 50% of robotic process automation projects fail. To tackle this issue, we use a design science research approach to develop a framework for the implementation of robotic process automation projects. We analyzed 35 reports on real-life projects to derive a preliminary sequential model. Then, we performed multiple expert interviews and workshops to validate and refine our model. The result is a framework with variable stages that offers guidelines with enough flexibility to be applicable in complex and heterogeneous corporate environments as well as for small and medium-sized companies. It is structured by the three phases of initialization, implementation, and scaling. They comprise eleven stages relevant during a project and as a continuous cycle spanning individual projects. Together they structure how to manage knowledge and support processes for the execution of robotic process automation implementation projects."

The proactive attitude toward such change is to be prepared, meaning, it is a very relevant issue to ask for the required competences which enable a person not only to cope with the digital transformation but maybe even to shape and steer it. For the project management community, this raises the question of how the well-elaborated project management competences match with the ones required for the digital transformation. On the one hand, we expect projects to be a major tool for shaping the digital transformation, on the other hand, we expect the way we do projects to be digitally transformed. Besides that pull effect caused by the obvious need for projects and the digital transformation, there is a possible push effect since the project management community could transfer their elaborated and proven view on competences (for project management) into the new domain of the digital transformation. This contribution attempts to structure the topic “competences” with the ambition to document what consequences the digital transformation has for our dealing with competences and what our elaborated systems of competence models, etc., can provide for the definition of the relevant competences for the digital transformation. By defining structures and terminologies, the foundation for a continuous development and iterative refinement of a competence baseline for the digital transformation is laid."

This paper discusses the benefits of carrying out continuous client feedback and communication processes throughout the lifecycle of information technology projects in higher education to assess and evaluate the condition of a project. The discussion includes the impact of customer participation on IT project performance as part of project quality management. Research shows that quality communication between stakeholders and project team members results in fewer misunderstandings and more precise definitions; however, there is a literature gap when it comes to assessing IT projects within higher education. Confirming expectations to improve customer perceptions of the project process and performance has a positive effect on client satisfaction. The paper emphasizes the importance of transparency on the part of IT in higher education project work, particularly in public universities, by involving higher education staff in all phases of the project, from project prioritization and selection to analysis, design, and implementation of the solution. Best practices for assessment and improving project outcomes are offered, as well as managing project quality and information flow. Future research directions are also offered."

These barriers could increase when the goal is the integration of civilian and military innovation structures. This paper discusses how the Research and Development Center of the Ecuadorian Air Force overcomes these barriers by project management solutions. A long-term and multidisciplinary project is presented as a case study. The center becomes the link between the defense industry and universities creating a support and administrative structure for this project. The case studies validate barriers identified in the literature and present some solutions for cultural, institutional, and operative barriers."

Cost of project development encompasses a software project’s effort and development time. One popular model of software cost estimation is constructive cost model (COCOMO) model, which is a mathematical model proposed by Boehm, used for estimate the software effort and development time. The objective of this paper is to improve the basic COCOMO model’s coefficients for modern programming languages like Python, R, C++, etc. Many techniques were presented in the past for effort and time estimation using machine learning. But all these techniques were trained and tested for older programming languages. In order to improve the accuracy of COCOMO for modern programming languages, six Python projects have been considered and genetic algorithm (GA) is applied in these projects to define new values for basic COCOMO coefficients and the development time is calculated for Python projects. The time estimated using GA coefficients is compared with the original COCOMO and actual time. Using mean magnitude relative error, the error from the original COCOMO time is 54.49% and error from GA time is 21.23%."
Finding the sweet spot for organizational control and team autonomy in large-scale agile software development,Empirical Software Engineering,,,,10.1007/s10664-021-09967-3,Nils Brede MoeDarja ŠmiteMaria PaasivaaraCasper Lassenius,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-021-09967-3,Article,"Agile methods and the related concepts of employee empowerment, self-management, and autonomy have reached large-scale software organizations and raise questions about commonly adopted principles for authority distribution. However, the optimum mechanism to balance the need for alignment, quality, and process control with the need or willingness of teams to be autonomous remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we report our findings from a multiple-case study in two large-scale software development organizations in the telecom industry. We analysed the autonomy of the agile teams in the organizations using Hackman’s classification of unit authority and found that the teams were partly self-managing. Further, we found that alignment across teams can be achieved top-down by management and bottom-up through membership in communities or through dialogue between the team and management. However, the degree of team autonomy was limited by the need for organizational alignment. Top-down alignment and control were maintained through centralized decision-making for certain areas, the use of supervisory roles, mandatory processes, and checklists. One case employed a bottom-up approach to alignment through the formation of a community composed of all teams, experts, and supporting roles, but excluding managers. This community-based alignment involved teams in decision-making and engaged them in alignment initiatives. We conclude that implementation of such bottom-up structures seems to provide one possible mechanism for balancing organizational control and team autonomy in large-scale software development."

However, they also bring unintended pitfalls of information insecurity, and these have not been studied sufficiently in an empirical way. System reliability as one of the quality attributes of information security, was investigated within the context of smart parking information system due to its close relevance with the ongoing smart city development globally. Through fuzzy fault tree analysis with the aid of structured interviews, it was found that a failure in a central system server may be caused by malicious attacks, human errors, and hardware and software failures. Survey results showed that improving firewalls and renewing recovery plans are necessary to defend against rampant malicious attacks; human errors as a non-technological factor may be reduced by well-planned training programs besides good operational governance and a timely recovery plan. Although system downtime is unavoidable, it can be reduced by proactive solutions including data backup and the provision of redundant servers and power supplies. All in all, an integrated approach is needed to mitigate against system unreliability."

When a software project is planned, it is common practice to predict the corresponding ST effort (STEP) as a percentage of predicted SDLC effort. However, the effort range for ST has been reported between 10 and 60% of the predicted SDLC effort. This wide range on STEP causes uncertainty in software managers due to STEP is used for allocating resources to teams exclusively for testing activities, and for budgeting and bidding the projects. In spite of this concern, hundreds of studies have been published since 1981 about SDLC effort prediction models, and only thirty-one STEP studies published in the last two decades were identified (just two of them based their conclusions on statistical significance). The contribution of the present study is to investigate the application for STEP of five machine learning (ML) models reported as the most accurate ones when applied to SDLC effort prediction. The models were trained and tested with data sets of projects selected from an international public repository of software projects. The selection for projects was based on their data quality rating, type of development, development platform, programming language generation, sizing method, and resource level of projects. Results based on statistical significance allow suggesting the application of specific ML models to software projects by type of development, and developed on a determined platform and programming language generation."

This paper provides the practical application of Digital as a Service (DaaS) with considerations and recommendations that cover the implementation of Big Data in Smart Infrastructure with some practical examples of real Infrastructure projects: Buildings, Airport, Stations and Intelligent Transport Systems. In addition, flagship projects have also to be delivered on time, budget and quality within a Health and Safety environment in order to be successful where the understanding of requirements and solutions is key and an Agile approach has some benefits to the traditional project management delivery."
A Post-colonial Analysis of Agile Software Development Methods in ICT4D,Information and Communication Technologies for Development,,,,10.1007/978-3-030-65828-1_6,Scarlet RahyDavid KrepsJulian M. BassTarek GaberAbdulhamid Ardo,2020,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-65828-1_6,Conference paper,"There is evidence that agile approaches to information system development can improve product quality and developer productivity. However, successful adoption of these approaches appears to depend on adaptation to specific contexts. This research contributes to a broader goal to understand what it means to “be agile” in the presence of adaptations to the specific context. To pursue our research objectives, we have performed 31 semi-structured recorded and transcribed practitioner interviews from three companies in Lebanon. The interview transcripts were analysed using an approach informed by grounded theory. Agile methods enable learning and improvement through team conversations. Yet, the practitioners in our study shun public self-evaluation, finding it difficult to discuss areas for improvement in public. We also found legacy “top down” management practices that undermine team autonomy and local client companies lack experience of engaging with agile processes. In a more positive vein, we found evidence of rich use of various communications channels to overcome geographical distance. On the one hand, agile methods represent a “northern” idea being propagated to the Global South. And yet, on the other hand, the agile concept of self-organising teams has the potential to be empowering and emancipatory. Post-colonial theory helps us understand the phenomenon of agile tailoring, where development process ceremonies are adapted to suite a specific local context."
Software development with feature toggles: practices used by practitioners,Empirical Software Engineering,,,,10.1007/s10664-020-09901-z,Rezvan Mahdavi-HezavehJacob DremannLaurie Williams,2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-020-09901-z,Article,"Background Using feature toggles is a technique that allows developers to either turn a feature on or off with a variable in a conditional statement. Feature toggles are increasingly used by software companies to facilitate continuous integration and continuous delivery. However, using feature toggles inappropriately may cause problems which can have a severe impact, such as code complexity, dead code, and system failure. For example, the erroneous repurposing of an old feature toggle caused Knight Capital Group, an American global financial services firm, to go bankrupt due to the implications of the resultant incorrect system behavior. Aim The goal of this research project is to aid software practitioners in the use of practices to support software development with feature toggles through an empirical study of feature toggle practice usage by practitioners. Method We conducted a qualitative analysis of 99 artifacts from the grey literature and 10 peer-reviewed papers about feature toggles. We conducted a survey of practitioners from 38 companies. Results We identified 17 practices in 4 categories: Management practices, Initialization practices, Implementation practices, and Clean-up practices. We observed that all of the survey respondents use a dedicated tool to create and manage feature toggles in their code. Documenting feature toggle’s metadata, setting up the default value for feature toggles, and logging the changes made on feature toggles are also frequently-observed practices. Conclusions The feature toggle development practices discovered and enumerated in this work can help practitioners more effectively use feature toggles. This work can enable future mining of code repositories to automatically identify feature toggle practices."

Kho,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13063-019-3634-7,Article,"Background Clinical trials management can be studied using project management theory. The CYCLE pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to determine the feasibility of a future rehabilitation trial of early in-bed cycling in the intensive care unit (ICU). In-bed cycling is a novel intervention, not typically available in ICUs. Implementation of this intervention requires personnel with specialized clinical expertise caring for critically ill patients and use of the in-bed cycle. Our objective was to describe the implementation and conduct of our pilot RCT using a project management approach. Methods We retrospectively reviewed activities, timelines, and personnel involved in the trial. We organized activities into four project management phases: initiation, planning, execution, and monitoring and controlling. Data sources included Methods Centre documents used for trial coordination and conduct, and the trial data set. We report descriptive statistics as counts and proportions and also medians and quartiles, and we summarize the lessons learned. Results Seven ICUs in Canada participated in the trial. Time from research ethics board and contracts submission to first enrolment was a median (first quartile, third quartile) of 185 (146, 209) and 162 (114, 181) days, respectively. We trained 128 personnel on the CYCLE pilot RCT protocol, and 80 (63%) completed trial-related activities. Four sites required additional training after start-up due to staff turnover and leaves of absence. Over 15 months, we screened 864 patients: 256 were eligible and 66 were enrolled. Despite an 85% consent rate, 74% (190/256) of eligible patients were not randomized, largely (80% [152/190]) due to physiotherapist availability. Thirteen percent of recruitment weeks were lost due to physiotherapist staffing shortages. We highlight five key lessons learned: (1) prepare and anticipate site needs; (2) communicate regularly; (3) proactively analyse and act on process measure data; (4) develop contingency plans; (5) express appreciation to participating sites. Conclusions Our analysis highlights the scope of relevant activities, rigorous training and monitoring, number and types of required personnel, and time required to conduct a multicentre ICU rehabilitation intervention trial. Our lessons learned can help others interested in implementing complex intervention trials, such as rehabilitation. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02377830 .

Reconfigurable jigs and fixtures are expected to facilitate customer-driven manufacturing. Scheduling of such fixtures in a mass customization system is yet to be comprehensively investigated. The chapter presents a three-stage method for the optimal scheduling of a two-cell just-in-time manufacturing system that recirculates fixtures for customized parts. The first two stages implemented clustering to produce fixture-part mappings, and intracluster sequencing to enable efficient successive fixture reconfigurations, respectively. The third stage implemented a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to synchronously schedule operations in the two specialized cells, such that total idle time was minimized. A heuristic was developed as an alternative to the MILP model. The paper discusses the three-stage method, with emphasis on the MILP model and Stage 3 Heuristic (S3H). The solutions were compared, and the goodness of the S3H solutions was evaluated in comparison to the optimal solutions. The S3H was found to produce solutions within a range of 5–35% of the corresponding optimal solutions, with far superior solutions times and problem size capabilities."

Although most heritage conservation projects have smaller budgets than new construction, the high uncertainty and complexities, necessitate robust project management framework. A well-defined project delivery framework is a key success factor for heritage conservation projects. India, with its rich cultural and geographical diversities, and more than 5000 years old civilization, has innumerable heritage sites spread across the country. Heritage conservation is a highly fragmented sector in India, with different agencies responsible for the protection and conservation of various heritage structures, and the modes, methods, and extent of conservation witnessed at these sites are of divergent nature. The objective of this paper is to study the different types of project delivery models used for heritage conservation in India. The authors have done an exploratory study on 50 heritage sites, where restoration projects are currently being executed or have been recently completed. The available project documents have been reviewed, and conservation professionals and other main stakeholders have been interviewed to map the project governance frameworks used for the projects. The 50 projects studied were categorized based on factors such as heritage category, ownership, implementing agency, scale of project, project frequency, funding pattern, apart from project delivery model and the relation between the factors studied analytically. The results indicate that Project Frequency and Funding Pattern are the significant factors influencing the selection of project delivery models for heritage conservation."

In this paper, we propose an improved Jaya optimization algorithm for minimizing the communication cost among team experts to solve team formation problem. The proposed algorithm is called an improved Jaya algorithm with a modified swap operator (IJMSO). We invoke a single-point crossover in the Jaya algorithm to accelerate the search, and we apply a new swap operator within Jaya algorithm to verify the consistency of the capabilities and the required skills to carry out the task. We investigate the IJMSO algorithm by implementing it on two real-life datasets (i.e., digital bibliographic library project and StackExchange) to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of proposed algorithm against other meta-heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, African buffalo optimization algorithm and standard Jaya algorithm. Experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvement in finding effective teams with minimum communication costs among team members for achieving the goal."

However, each role in the team has different informational needs in order to perform their activities. Thus, the requirements engineer should provide the necessary information to meet each team member's necessities to reduce errors in software development due to inadequate or insufficient communication. Although some research is concerned with communicating requirements among clients and analysts, no related research has been found to evaluate and improve requirements communication within the software development team. With this in mind, we present the ReComP framework, which assists in the identification of problems in the artifacts used to communicate requirements, identification of informational requirements for each role of the development team, and provide improvement suggestions to address requirements communication problems. ReComP was developed using the Design Science Research (DSR) method and this paper presents the results of two DSR cycles considering the use of ReComP for the developer and tester roles by using, respectively, user stories and use cases as requirements specifications. The results provide evidence that ReComP helps software development teams to identify and improve issues in the requirements specifications used for project communication. In two independent studies, ReComP was able to decrease the frequency of problems by 77% in user stories identified by developers and the frequency of all (100%) problems in use cases identified by testers."

The heterogeneous information in this paper indicates that the decision attribute value is represented by various types of data forms, including exact number, interval number, linguistic term, intuitionistic fuzzy number, interval intuitionistic fuzzy number, neutrosophic numbers, and trapezoidal fuzzy neutrosophic numbers, and so on. Firstly, the distance and similarity measure of various heterogeneous data are introduced, and the heterogeneous information attribute weights are obtained using the deviation maximization method. Then, the psychological expectation value of each attribute given by the decision maker is used as a reference point, thereby calculating the gain and loss of each attribute value relative to the reference point, and establishing a gain matrix and a loss matrix. On this basis, the prospect theory is used to obtain the comprehensive prospect value of each alternative, so as to obtain the alternative ordering result and optimal alternative. Finally, an illustrative example about typhoon disaster assessment is presented to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, and the advantages of the proposed method are illustrated by comparison with other methods."

The study covers a discussion about challenges, future developments, and open issues on JRSs via 6 research questions. Also, other review studies (8 RSs field and 11 JRSs field) were examined and compared. 527 articles were retrieved through our search query from both WoS and Google Scholar between January 1, 2010—April 30, 2023. Of these, 57 were deemed qualitatively appropriate and were included in the systematic review. A taxonomy of methodologies applied in both RSs and JRSs are developed. RSs taxonomy developed was associated with 6 categories: (1) Collaborative, (2) Content, (3) Hybrid, (4) Knowledgebase, (5) Context aware, and (6) Others. JRSs taxonomy developed was associated with 6 categories: (1) Collaborative, (2) Content, (3) Hybrid, (4) Knowledgebase, (5) Context aware, and (6) Reciprocal. Types of accuracy metrics used in both RSs and JRSs were categorized and compared. This study draws attention to the requirements in the development of effective JRSs within the scope of current RS technologies. Findings is a guidance for future R&D studies in the field of JRS for developers, practitioners and academics. Background The HR department has undergone substantial transformations, with a focus on improving recruitment, employee satisfaction, and training through technological integration, particularly with Recommender Systems (RSs) and Job Recommender Systems (JRSs). In addition, the adoption of remote working across multiple industries has significantly increased the need for smart technologies in Human Resources (HR) processes over time. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this shift, placing even greater emphasis on the utilization of these technologies. Objective Over the past decade, research on JRSs has increased significantly; however, no comprehensive Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has been conducted in this field. To fill this gap, this study conducts an SLR covering relevant RS and JRS studies published in the last 13 years. It aims to critically analyze commonly used methodologies, identify key research trends and gaps, provide a comprehensive overview of existing literature, define application areas in HR processes, classify performance evaluation metrics used, highlight underexplored themes, discuss limitations of current research, and offer recommendations for researchers and HR practitioners for future studies in the JRS field. Method In this SLR, a total of 19 survey articles (including both RSs and JRSs) and 57 research articles on JRS solutions, published between 2010 and 2023, were reviewed and categorized based on publication years, publishers, application themes, applied methodologies, RS filtering techniques, utilized tools, and future studies. Moreover, a comprehensive taxonomy was developed to classify the filtering techniques and methodologies used in both RSs and JRSs. The study also categorizes and classifies performance assessment metrics used in both RS and JRS solutions into four categories: Predictive Accuracy, Classification-Based Accuracy, Ranking-Based Accuracy, and Non-Accuracy-Based Metrics. Results Key findings reveal that while JRS solutions utilizing Collaborative, Content-Based, Hybrid-Based, and Knowledge-Based Filtering are well-represented in the literature, those applying Demographic-Based, Reciprocal-Based, Popularity-Based, and Non-Personalized Filtering remain underexplored. The methodologies highly employed in JRS research include similarity-based techniques (e.g., TOPSIS, Cosine Similarity), machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, LSTM), and knowledge-based approaches (e.g., Ontology, Semantic Web). Evaluation metrics vary significantly based on objectives and filtering techniques, with Classification-Based Accuracy Metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score) being the most commonly used. An analysis of historical trends in JRS publications revealed fluctuations in research interest, with a decline in 2011 and notable peaks in 2017 and 2023. The study also identified a lack of JRS solutions addressing broader HR processes beyond candidate-job matching. Conclusion As a result, JRSs are still under development and need further improvements, particularly in reducing bias and increasing efficiency in HR processes through advanced AI technologies. Over the past 13 years, JRS studies have explored a variety of themes, including recommending suitable team members, identifying training modules based on skill gaps, developing career path planning systems, assessing employee satisfaction, standardizing professional knowledge, analyzing job postings to determine the busiest job fields, and estimating job tenure and turnover intention. However, research on other crucial HR processes, such as workforce planning, personalized JRSs such as recruitment of special groups, employee engagement strategies, and talent retention frameworks, remains limited, highlighting opportunities to explore in the future."
Expanding Tracing Capabilities Using Dynamic Tracing Data,Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering,,,,10.1007/978-3-030-40223-5_16,Dennis ZiegenhagenAndreas SpeckElke Pulvermueller,2020,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-40223-5_16,Conference paper,"Software traceability enables gaining insight into artifact relationships and dependencies throughout software development. This information can be used to support project maintenance and to reduce costs, e.g. by estimating the impact of artifact changes. Many traceability applications require manual effort for creating and managing the necessary data. Current approaches aim at reducing this effort by automating various involved tasks. To support this, we propose an enrichment of tracing data by capturing interactions that influence the artifacts’ life-cycle, which we refer to as dynamic tracing data . Its purpose is to expand capabilities of traceability applications and to enable assistance in development tasks. In this paper, we present our research methodology and current results, most importantly a flexible and modular framework for capturing and using dynamic tracing data, as well as an example scenario to demonstrate a possible implementation and usage of the framework."
Automatic tutoring system to support cross-disciplinary training in Big Data,The Journal of Supercomputing,,,,10.1007/s11227-020-03330-x,Xavier Solé-BetetaJoan NavarroDavid VernetAgustín ZaballosRicardo Torres-KompenDavid FonsecaAlan Briones,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-020-03330-x,Article,"During the last decade, Big Data has emerged as a powerful alternative to address latent challenges in scalable data management. The ever-growing amount and rapid evolution of tools, techniques, and technologies associated to Big Data require a broad skill set and deep knowledge of several domains—ranging from engineering to business, including computer science, networking, or analytics among others—which complicate the conception and deployment of academic programs and methodologies able to effectively train students in this discipline. The purpose of this paper is to propose a learning and teaching framework committed to train masters’ students in Big Data by conceiving an intelligent tutoring system aimed to (1) automatically tracking students’ progress, (2) effectively exploiting the diversity of their backgrounds, and (3) assisting the teaching staff on the course operation. Obtained results endorse the feasibility of this proposal and encourage practitioners to use this approach in other domains."
Quality assessment in competition-based software crowdsourcing,Frontiers of Computer Science,,,,10.1007/s11704-019-8418-4,Zhenghui HuWenjun WuJie LuoXin WangBoshu Li,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11704-019-8418-4,Article,"Quality assessment is a critical component in crowdsourcing-based software engineering (CBSE) as software products are developed by the crowd with unknown or varied skills and motivations. In this paper, we propose a novel metric called the project score to measure the performance of projects and the quality of products for competition-based software crowdsourcing development (CBSCD) activities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to deal with the quality issue of CBSE in the perspective of projects instead of contests. In particular, we develop a hierarchical quality evaluation framework for CBSCD projects and come up with two metric aggregation models for project scores. The first model is a modified squale model that can locate the software modules of poor quality, and the second one is a clustering-based aggregation model, which takes different impacts of phases into account. To test the effectiveness of the proposed metrics, we conduct an empirical study on TopCoder, which is a famous CBSCD platform. Results show that the proposed project score is a strong indicator of the performance and product quality of CBSCD projects. We also find that the clustering-based aggregation model outperforms the Squale one by increasing the percentage of the performance evaluation criterion of aggregation models by an additional 29%. Our approach to quality assessment for CBSCD projects could potentially facilitate software managers to assess the overall quality of a crowdsourced project consisting of programming contests."

Contributing Features-Based Schemes for Software Defect Prediction,Artificial Intelligence XXXVI,,,,10.1007/978-3-030-34885-4_27,Aftab AliMamun Abu-TairJoost NoppenSally McCleanZhiwei LinIan McChesney,2019,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-34885-4_27,Conference paper,"Automated defect prediction of large and complex software systems is a challenging task. However, by utilising correlated quality metrics, a defect prediction model can be devised to automatically predict the defects in a software system. The robustness and accuracy of a prediction model is highly dependent on the selection of contributing and non-contributing features. Hence, in this regard, the contribution of this paper is twofold, first it separates those features which are contributing towards the development of a defect in a software component from those which are non-contributing features. Secondly, a logistic regression and Ensemble Bagged Trees-based prediction model are applied on the contributing features for accurately predicting a defect in a software component. The proposed models are compared with the most recent scheme in the literature in terms of accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). It is evident from the results and analysis that the performance of the proposed prediction models outperforms the schemes in the literature."

Risk management standards and the active management of malicious intent in artificial superintelligence,AI & SOCIETY,,,,10.1007/s00146-019-00890-2,Patrick Bradley,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-019-00890-2,Article,"The likely near future creation of artificial superintelligence carries significant risks to humanity. These risks are difficult to conceptualise and quantify, but malicious use of existing artificial intelligence by criminals and state actors is already occurring and poses risks to digital security, physical security and integrity of political systems. These risks will increase as artificial intelligence moves closer to superintelligence. While there is little research on risk management tools used in artificial intelligence development, the current global standard for risk management, ISO 31000:2018, is likely used extensively by developers of artificial intelligence technologies. This paper argues that risk management has a common set of vulnerabilities when applied to artificial superintelligence which cannot be resolved within the existing framework and alternative approaches must be developed. Some vulnerabilities are similar to issues posed by malicious threat actors such as professional criminals and terrorists. Like these malicious actors, artificial superintelligence will be capable of rendering mitigation ineffective by working against countermeasures or attacking in ways not anticipated by the risk management process. Criminal threat management recognises this vulnerability and seeks to guide and block the intent of malicious threat actors as an alternative to risk management. An artificial intelligence treachery threat model that acknowledges the failings of risk management and leverages the concepts of criminal threat management and artificial stupidity is proposed. This model identifies emergent malicious behaviour and allows intervention against negative outcomes at the moment of artificial intelligence’s greatest vulnerability."
Factors Shaping Information Security Culture in an Internal IT Department,"HCI International 2020 – Late Breaking Papers: Interaction, Knowledge and Social Media",,,,10.1007/978-3-030-60152-2_38,Peter DornheimRüdiger Zarnekow,2020,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-60152-2_38,Conference paper,"Companies are exposed to the risk of falling victim to cyber attacks every day and therefore invest in optimizing their information security (IS) level. In addition to technological investments, the focus is now increasingly on employees, as their attitude and behavior has a significant influence on the IS level of a company. There is already extensive research on the influencing factors and the establishment of an IS culture in companies. However, little attention has been paid to the group of IT employees, although it has been proven that their attitude, behavior and judgment regarding cyber attacks and IS in general differ from non-IT employees. Even within an IT department, one can expect to see different degrees of these factors, as a distinction must be made between IS employees and employees with traditional IT functions (software development, server operation, etc.). Based on 25 recent IS studies, a literature review has identified four factors that influence the IS attitude and behavior of employees in an internal IT department and thus have an impact on the IS culture. These four components are IT tools, IS skill, appreciation and sub-cultures. The results show that more qualitative research with a focus on employees of an IT department is necessary to advance the findings in the area of IS culture. In addition, CIOs and CISOs benefit from the results, as they specify fields of action that can be tested and optimized in their own organizations."

The NPD process fulfils all conditions of project’s definition; that’s why many authors present the possibilities of applying to NPD process management instruments, specific for project management. Such attempts are limited to classical project managements methodologies and tools. Recently we observe growing interest in Scrum methodology, [ 3 , 4 ]. Introduced for IT project management, nowadays is transferring completely or partially to manage the projects in other than IT fields of activities - healthcare, finance, consulting, education, and others, giving good results. This paper is a conceptual one, presenting an attempt made to show the possibility, utility and manner of transferring principal elements of Scrum toward NPD process. The objective of the paper is turn spotlight of New Product Development specialists on such possibility and encourage them to apply Scrum in this process management. The objective is achieved mainly in Sect.  5 , where for all steps and activities in NPD process, their classification has been done, dividing them on unique or cyclical. The last ones (they are in the majority) can be managed according to Scrum methodology. It has been shown, for respective Scrum elements: roles, events and artefacts, how they can work in NPD process management. This study needs further research and empirical verification."
A hybrid model of wavelet neural network and metaheuristic algorithm for software development effort estimation,International Journal of Information Technology,,,,10.1007/s41870-019-00339-1,Anupama KaushikNiyati Singal,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41870-019-00339-1,Article,Software development effort estimation (SDEE) means estimating software cost and effort at the early stage of software development. It is a difficult task as the characteristics of software to be developed are not known at the time of estimation of software effort. But this is very important for software development organizations as it ultimately leads to the project’s success. This paper proposes a non-algorithmic technique for SDEE i.e. a hybrid model of wavelet neural network (WNN) and metaheuristic algorithm. Two metaheuristic algorithms i.e. firefly algorithm and bat algorithm are used. The efficiency of WNN with integration of each of these metaheuristic algorithms is investigated. Two variants of wavelet functions—Morlet and Gaussian are used as activation functions in WNN. The proposed techniques are experimentally evaluated on PROMISE SDEE repositories. It was observed that integrating metaheuristic algorithms with WNN outperformed the results of software effort prediction in comparison to traditional WNN which is not optimized using any metaheuristic technique. The results are also statistically validated using a non-parametric statistical test using IBM SPSS tool.

The estimation of software cost is controlled by multiple factors right from human-driven to process driven. Most importantly, some of the factors are never even can be guessed. At present, there are no records of literature to offer a robust cost estimation model to address this problem. Therefore, the proposed system introduces an intellectual model of software cost model that is mainly targets to perform optimization of entire cost estimation modeling by incorporating predictive approach. Powered by deep learning approach, the outcome of the proposed model is found to be cost effective in comparison to existing cost estimation modeling."
Detecting topic-level influencers in large-scale scientific networks,World Wide Web,,,,10.1007/s11280-019-00751-4,Yang QianYezheng LiuYuanchun JiangXiao Liu,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11280-019-00751-4,Article,"Scientific networks play an increasingly important role in facilitating knowledge and technique diffusion. In such networks, highly influential nodes (scientists or literatures) are prone to stimulate other researchers in the generation of innovative ideas. The objective of this study is to detect topic-level influencers from a large collection of links between nodes and textual contents in scientific networks. For this purpose, we propose a sparse link topic model (SLTM) that introduces a “Spike and Slab” prior to achieve sparsity in node-topic distribution. Compared with previous approaches, our model assumes that a node usually focuses on several salient topics instead of a wide range of topics, which is useful in learning topic-level influencers in scientific networks. In addition, a collapsed variational Bayesian (CVB) inference algorithm is designed for large-scale applications. Our experiments are conducted on a large scientific collaboration network. The results reveal that the proposed model significantly improves the precision of topic-level detection. Our analysis also reflects that SLTM can explicitly model the sparse topical structure of each node in the network."

The examples of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and highly automated driving (HAD) are being implemented inside already complex systems, themselves evolving at a high pace in new powertrain architectures, body controllers, gateways or infotainment systems. As described by Navale et al. [1], Stolz et al. [2] and presented by Haas and Langjahr at Stuttgart Symposium 2016 [3], E/E architectures are undergoing an evolution from pure mechanical systems to highly centralized E/E vehicle architectures, see Figure 1. Central element and core of the systems are electronic control units (ECU). ECUs evolved from modular one-box one-function units to systems with higher integration level to reduce the overall number of controllers in the vehicle. Each domain, like powertrain or brake system (ABS/ESP), is today usually controlled by one domain specific central ECU acting as master. With increasing requirements and interaction between these domains, for instance for the cruise control function acting on the brake system and on the powertrain, ECUs acting at overall vehicle level come into play."

A brief overview of the benefits of an ontology-based approach to requirements engineering is given. Attention is focused on agile engineering requirements process. The proposed approach uses three ontologies. The first ontology is used to represent knowledge about the agile requirements engineering process. The second ontology is designed to match natural language sentences with the requirements in order to identify conflicts. The third ontology is used to accumulate the knowledge about the domain of the software product. The first ontology is core. This ontology consists of classes corresponding to events, roles and artefacts of agile development. Object properties established between the individuals of class can be used to identify directly or indirectly linked requirements and requirements artefacts. This enables maintaining requirements traceability. Also the ontology takes into account particular qualities of working with the requirements in agile development processes including knowledge about the criteria for assessing the quality of user stories that is the most common form to record the requirements in agile methods. The ontologies are implemented in the Protégé environment."

Comparing the competencies described within each context has typically not be done, which has generated a complete disconnect in language between them. This work presents an approach for the alignment of online profiles and job advertisements, according to knowledge and skills, using measures of lexical, syntactic and taxonomic similarity. In addition, we use a ranking that allows the alignment of the profiles to the topics of a thesaurus that define competencies. The results are promising, because the combination of the measures of similarity with the alignment with thesauri of competencies offers robustness to the process of generation of professional competence descriptions. This combination allows dealing with the common problems of synonymy, homonymy, hypernymy/hyponymy and meronymy of the terms in Spanish. This research uses natural language processing to offer a novel approach for assessing the match of the competencies described by the applicants and by the employers, even if they use different terminology. The resulting approach, while developed in Spanish for computer science jobs, can be extended to other languages and domains, such is the case of recruitment, where it will contribute to the creation of better tools that give feedback to job seekers about how to best align their competencies with job opportunities."

Although typically a plethora of process reference-like models and other best practice resources are available to potentially close the criticized gaps, companies are reluctant to move towards the implied multi-model-based process management approaches or to customize or extend existing models according their proprietary needs. Approaches and methods to develop, enhance or customize available models or to integrate multiple models are often not satisfactorily understood and far away from being industry practice. The goal of the research underlying this paper is thus to support the development and enhancement of process reference models for complex industry contexts. As a sample domain the area of product development and management in the software and systems engineering domain is used. The paper analyses the development of four industry-driven model development cases to identify their model development contexts and goals as well as development strategies, approaches, and related rationales. The aim of the paper is to contribute to the understanding of how process reference models are developed and how they can be enhanced or adapted to broader and more complex contexts in order to deliver value and competitive advantage to the respective businesses."

SCRUM and XP in industrial settings and UPEDU in academic ones are main of them. Similarly, Software Process Improvement (SPI) initiatives promote the utilization of process frameworks and standards. However, despite both worlds (i.e. ASDMs and SPI) pursue a shared end of high-quality software, both are separated by different underlying approaches. We consider that ASDMs can get benefits from SPI through controlled enhancements (i.e. an agile-discipline balance) without elimination of agility. Thus, in this research, we report the design of SCRUM+, an enhanced SCRUM with recommendations on roles, activities-tasks and artifacts from the SPI standard ISO/IEC 29110. SCRUM+ was designed by using a Means-Ends analysis. Our final aim is to provide such an enhanced SCRUM methodology via an Electronic Process Guide (EPG) to help practitioners for a better use of agile approaches with SPI added recommendations that be found theoretically robust and potentially useful regarding SCRUM from a panel of experts and SCRUM practitioners."

HF is largely applied in several fields such as industrial processes, education, training, and design. In software development, HF plays a crucial role in the efficient and effective development of a software product and the success of the final product. This paper aims at indicating the state of the art of the literature on HF in software, in general and in the software development process in particular. To do so, a preliminary literature review using text mining has been performed. This work gathered papers using the terms “human factors” and “software” from four of the most used scientific digital databases (ACM DL, Scopus, Science Direct and IEEE Xplore). A total of 2192 papers were selected and automatically gathered into three clusters by using the X-means algorithm, which automatically recommended that number of clusters. The results show that there are three main areas where HF have been researched within software development: (1) the field of product evaluation (user experience) (2) the field of software development process, especially in the project management processes (3) the field of education. The results are an initial indication of the evolution of research in this area and where and how HF is applied in software engineering."

For instance, Personality types, especially Introvert (I) and Extrovert (E) traits, of team members of software development are explored with gender diversity with a key focus on the programmer role. Moreover, descriptive and predictive approaches were applied to gain the hidden facts from data. The data of this study was taken from both academia and industry to establish the generalizability in the findings. Additionally, different personality traits composition was set based on gender which was not studied in previous studies. The findings of this research suggest that male-programmer should be composed of E trait of personality and, whereas female-programmer should be I. The overall findings contribute to serve the cause of software development team and also contribute to the existing literature on software development and its team composition."
Lean Healthcare Project Leader: A Framework Based on Functions and Competencies,Industrial Engineering and Operations Management II,,,,10.1007/978-3-030-14973-4_25,Thiago A.

Such developments are often not integrated with the hospital management system, nor performed according to the dynamics of each professional area, or even not governed by trained and empowered lean healthcare project leaders. This study proposes, by means of an action research approach, to raise the functions and competencies that a Lean Healthcare project manager needs to develop projects using DMAIC as general guide. From the case of a large hospital in southeastern Brazil, the researchers listed general project management functions, technical and behavioral competencies, and present a general method for conducting lean projects in a hospital environment. As a conclusion of the study is perceived that the required competencies are related to the literature studied in project management and lean thinking, namely, Communication, Teamwork, Focus on Results, and a Systemic Vision. These were evaluated as the basic competencies for a Lean Healthcare Project Leader."
The State of Agile Software Development in the Czech Republic: Preliminary Findings Indicate the Dominance of “Abridged” Scrum,Research and Practical Issues of Enterprise Information Systems,,,,10.1007/978-3-030-37632-1_4,Michal DolezelAlena BuchalcevovaMichal Mencik,2019,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-37632-1_4,Conference paper,"This paper presents preliminary results from a survey focused on the state of agile method adoption in the Czech Republic. To this end, an initial survey sample (N = 120) was analyzed. Scrum is the most frequently used agile software development method, reported by 46.7% of respondents as the agile method of choice. However, the results indicate that Scrum seems to be introduced through cherry-picking of those practices that are quite easy to implement. Specifically, the only widely-spread Scrum practice is the maintenance of Product backlog. To the contrary, the teams are rarely cross-functional and the Scrum master role frequently absents. This suggests that in many organizations, Scrum might be invoked due to being a valuable “brand name”, rather than due to professionals’ subscribing to core Scrum values and assumptions. Our results contribute to the body of empirical knowledge on the state of agile software development initiatives. Our findings confirm the theoretical proposition that in the real world, the implementation of software development methods is often patchy and rarely done “by the book”."
Unsupervised software defect prediction using median absolute deviation threshold based spectral classifier on signed Laplacian matrix,Journal of Big Data,,,,10.1186/s40537-019-0250-z,Aris MarjuniTeguh B. AdjiRidi Ferdiana,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-019-0250-z,Article,"Area of interest The trend of current software inevitably leads to the big data era. There are much of large software developed from hundreds to thousands of modules. In software development projects, finding the defect proneness manually on each module in large software dataset is probably inefficient in resources. In this task, the use of a software defect prediction model becomes a popular solution with much more cost-effective rather than manual reviews. This study presents a specific machine learning algorithm, which is the spectral classifier, to develop a software defect prediction model using unsupervised learning approach. Background and objective The spectral classifier has been successfully used in software defect prediction because of its reliability to consider the similarities between software entities. However, there are conditional issues when it uses the zero value as partitioning threshold. The classifier will produce the predominantly cluster when the eigenvector values are mostly positives. Besides, it will also generate low clusters compactness when the eigenvector contains outliers. The objective of this study is mainly to propose an alternative partitioning threshold in dealing with the zero threshold issues. Generally, the proposed method is expected to improve the spectral classifier based software defect prediction performances. Methods This study proposes the median absolute deviation threshold based spectral classifier to carry out the zero value threshold issues. The proposed method considers the eigenvector values dispersion measure as the new partitioning threshold, rather than using a central tendency measure (e.g., zero, mean, median). The baseline method of this study is the zero value threshold based spectral classifier. Both methods are performed on the signed Laplacian matrix to meet the non-negative Laplacian graph assumption. For classification, the heuristic row sum method is used to assign the entity class as the prediction label. Results and conclusion In terms of clustering, the proposed method can produce better cluster memberships that affect the cluster compactness and the classifier performances improvement. The cluster compactness average of both the proposed and baseline methods are 1.4 DBI and 1.8 DBI, respectively. In classification performance, the proposed method performs better accuracy with lower error rates than the baseline method. The proposed method also has high precision but low in the recall, which means that the proposed method can detect the software defect more precisely, although in the small number in detection. The proposed method has the accuracy, precision, recall, and error rates with average values of 0.79, 0.84, 0.72, and 0.21, respectively. While the baseline method has the accuracy, precision, recall, and error rates with average values of 0.74, 0.74, 0.89, and 0.26, respectively. Based on those results, the proposed method able to provide a viable solution to address the zero threshold issues in the spectral classifier. Hence, this study concludes that the use of the median absolute deviation threshold can improve the spectral based unsupervised software defect prediction method."

Moreover, risk mitigation used to monitor a project continuously through effective communication is limited. Risk management is critical for achieving success in software projects. It is an improvement process implemented through the institutionalization of best practices among software development teams. Such institutionalization assists in reducing costs, achieving higher levels of client satisfaction, increasing productivity, and reducing project failure. All of the above, it’s necessary define risk management techniques for minimize the effort and guaranteeing the respect of the agile manifesto. Using the risk analysis, reviewing techniques to be adopted by the agile teams and incorporating improvement strategies such as the gamification could be an alternative method to obtain a risk analysis proposal for agile environments. This proposal aims to develop a strategy for analyzing the project risks by a software development team, incorporating agile methodologies, and applying gamification elements for motivating team members to reduce the time for completing the risk management cycle."

Moreover, there is no agreement about the necessary level of interpretability of such solution and on how this level can be determined, measured and achieved. In this article, we provide such definitions based on research as well as our extensive experience of building ML solutions for various organisations across industries. We present CRISP-ML, a detailed step-by-step methodology, that provides guidance on creating the necessary level of interpretability at each stage of the solution building process and is consistent with the best practices of project management in the ML settings. We illustrate the versatility and effortless applicability of CRISP-ML with examples across a variety of industries and types of ML projects."

To do so, universities must consider the complex working environments; recent technologies; and tools and skills, in order to prepare students to fulfill the expectations of the software industry. This study was carried out in a Brazilian private university, specifically in courses called Interdisciplinary Software Project (ISP) of the SE major. These courses are project-based, conducted by two professors at the same time in classroom, following a Scrum-like process. The objective of this study was to characterize how students work and collaborate in a group environment where agile development is used as well as how their behavior reflect on the use of Software Configuration Management (SCM) practices. In order to achieve this objective, the study analyzed 38 students’ code repositories. This study has found out that students procrastinate sprint work, since 51% of the commits are performed when less than 20% of the sprint time is left. We have also observed that in 87% of the groups just one member is a top contributor and would harm the projects’ outcomes if he/she left the project. In terms of SCM practices, we have identified that most commits comprised changes in up to three files. Moreover, most commit messages are less than 10 words long. This could mean that students do not commit many alterations at the same time but could make better use of messages in order to facilitate the comprehension of alterations by other members."

This paper presents an approach to Search Based Software Project Management based on parallel implementation of evolutionary algorithm on GPU. We redesigned evolutionary algorithm to cater for the purpose of parallel programming. Our approach aims to parallelize the genetic operators including: crossover, mutation and evaluation in the evolution process to achieve faster execution. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a “proof of concept” empirical study, using data from three real-world software projects. Both sequential and parallel version of a conventional single objective evolutionary algorithm are implemented. The sequential version is based on common programming approach using C++, and the parallel version is based on GPGPU programming approach using CUDA. Results indicate that even a relatively cheap graphic card (GeForce GTX 970) can speed up the optimization process significantly. We believe that deploy parallel evolutionary algorithm based on GPU may fit many applications for other software project management problems, since software projects often have complex inter-related work packages and resources, and are typically characterized by large scale problems which optimization process ought to be accelerated by parallelism."

Re-estimating software effort using prior phase efforts and data mining techniques,Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering,,,,10.1007/s11334-018-0311-z,Pichai JodpimaiPeraphon SophatsathitChidchanok Lursinsap,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11334-018-0311-z,Article,"Software effort estimation has played an important role in software project management. An accurate estimation helps reduce cost overrun and the eventual project failure. Unfortunately, many existing estimation techniques rely on the total project effort which is often determined from the project life cycle. As the project moves on, the course of action deviates from what originally has planned, despite close monitoring and control. This leads to re-estimating software effort so as to improve project operating costs and budgeting. Recent research endeavors attempt to explore phase level estimation that uses known information from prior development phases to predict effort of the next phase by using different learning techniques. This study aims to investigate the influence of preprocessing in prior phases on learning techniques to re-estimate the effort of next phase. The proposed re-estimation approach preprocesses prior phase effort by means of statistical techniques to select a set of input features for learning which in turn are exploited to generate the estimation models. These models are then used to re-estimate next phase effort by using four processing steps, namely data transformation, outlier detection, feature selection, and learning. An empirical study is conducted on 440 estimation models being generated from combinations of techniques on 5 data transformation, 5 outlier detection, 5 feature selection, and 5 learning techniques. The experimental results show that suitable preprocessing is significantly useful for building proper learning techniques to boosting re-estimation accuracy. However, there is no one learning technique that can outperform other techniques over all phases. The proposed re-estimation approach yields more accurate estimation than proportion-based estimation approach. It is envisioned that the proposed re-estimation approach can facilitate researchers and project managers on re-estimating software effort so as to finish the project on time and within the allotted budget."
Applying the results based management framework to the CERCA multi-component project in adolescent sexual and reproductive health: a retrospective analysis,Reproductive Health,,,,10.1186/s12978-018-0461-3,Kathya Cordova-PozoAndrea J. HoopesFreddy CordovaBernardo VegaZoyla SeguraArnold Hagens,2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12978-018-0461-3,Article,"Background Adolescent sexual and reproductive health (SRH), problems such as unplanned pregnancies are complex and multifactorial, thus requiring multifaceted prevention interventions. Evaluating the impact of such interventions is important to ensure efficiency, effectiveness and accountability for project funders and community members. In this study, we propose Results Based Management (RBM) as a framework for project management, using the Community Embedded Reproductive Health Care for Adolescents (CERCA) as a case study for RBM. The CERCA Project (2010-2014) tested interventions to reduce adolescent pregnancy in three Latin American countries, Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua. Activities were designed to increase adolescent SRH behaviors in four domains: communication with parents, partners and peers; access to SRH information; access to SRH services; and use of contraception. When the project ended, the outcome evaluation showed limited impact with concerns about accuracy of monitoring and attrition of participants. Methods We reviewed and analyzed a series of CERCA documents and related data sources. Key findings from these documents were organized within an RBM framework (planning, monitoring, and impact evaluation) to understand how CERCA methodology and performance might have reaped improved results. Results Strengths and weaknesses were identified in all three elements of the RBM framework. In Planning, the proposed Theory of Change (ToC) differed from that which was carried out in the intervention package. Each country implemented a different intervention package without articulated assumptions on how the activities of intervention would bring about change. In Monitoring, the project oversight was mainly based on administrative and financial requirements rather than monitoring fidelity and quality of intervention activities. In Impact Evaluation, the original CERCA evaluation assessed intervention effects among adolescents, without identifying success and failure factors related to the outcomes, the nature of the outcomes, or cost-effectiveness of interventions. Conclusions This analysis showed that multi-country projects are complex, entail risks in execution and require robust project management. RBM can be a useful tool to ensure a systematic approach at different phases within a multi-country setting. Antecedentes La salud sexual y reproductiva de los adolescentes (SSR), como problemas de embarazos no planificados son complejos y multifactoriales, por lo que requieren múltiples intervenciones para su prevención. Evaluar el impacto de estas intervenciones es importante para asegurar la eficiencia, la eficacia y la rendición de cuentas para los donantes de proyectos y los miembros de la comunidad. En este estudio, proponemos la Gestión Basada en Resultados (o su sigla en inglés RBM) como un marco para la gestión de proyectos, utilizando el Community Embedded Reproductive Health Care for Adolescents (CERCA) como un caso de estudio para RBM. El Proyecto CERCA (2010-2014) puso a prueba las intervenciones para reducir el embarazo adolescente en tres países de América Latina, Bolivia, Ecuador y Nicaragua. Las actividades fueron diseñadas para mejorar los comportamientos adolescentes en SRH en cuatro aspectos: comunicación con padres, compañeros y pareja; acceso a la información sobre SSR; acceso a los servicios de SSR; y uso de anticonceptivos. Cuando el proyecto terminó, la evaluación de resultados mostró un impacto limitado sobre todo por la precisión en el monitoreo y pérdidas en el seguimiento de cohortes. Métodos Se revisó y analizó una serie de documentos CERCA y fuentes de datos relacionados. Las principales conclusiones de estos documentos se organizaron en el marco lógico de la Gestión Basada en Resultados (planificación, monitoreo y evaluación del impacto) para comprender cómo la metodología y el rendimiento de CERCA podrían haber obtenido mejores resultados. Resultados Se identificaron fortalezas y debilidades en los tres elementos del marco de RBM. En la Planificación, la propuesta Teoría del Cambio (ToC) difiere de la que se llevó a cabo en el paquete de intervención. Cada país implementó un paquete de intervención diferente sin supuestos articulados sobre cómo estas actividades de intervención producirían cambios. En el Monitoreo, la gestión del proyecto se basó principalmente en requisitos administrativos y financieros en lugar de supervisar la fidelidad y la calidad de las actividades de intervención. En la Evaluación de Impacto, la evaluación original del CERCA evaluó los efectos de la intervención entre los adolescentes, sin identificar los factores de éxito y fracaso relacionados con los resultados, la naturaleza de los resultados o el análisis de costo-efectividad de las intervenciones. Conclusiones Este análisis mostró que los proyectos multinacionales son complejos, implican riesgos en la ejecución y requieren una gestión del proyecto sólida. La Gestión Basada en Resultados puede ser una herramienta útil para garantizar un enfoque sistemático en las distintas fases de un proyecto bajo un contexto multi-país."

Classical software development models were successfully used with conventional applications with or without adaptations, but due to the distinctive characteristics of apps, these development models are not suitable to rely upon. Agile development models proved themselves worthy of using in different development environments and team traits irrespective of the software application size. It is evident that incorporating agility in the software development paradigm not only speeds up the development process, but it also eases the communication flow between the client and the development team. It is also observed that peculiar characteristic of an app development project is the constant negotiations between the client and the team. Thus, agile and mobile forms a ridge-and-groove formation and deem fit to fulfill various parameters of mobile application development—if applied appropriately. The objective of this paper is to determine the agility of an app project in the subject and to propose a recommendation framework based on this agility and other project characteristics. For convenience, we call this framework as MAAF—Mobile Application Agility Framework. This framework is validated by assigning the same project to be built by four different agile teams. Out of the four agile teams, one team used the technique recommended by the proposed framework, and the other three teams adopted agile methods of their choice. This process is repeated for five different mobile app projects. The developed apps were later presented to the user community for ratings. The rating reports suggest that the proposed recommendation framework based on agility indeed works satisfactorily. The outcome of this work will help app developers and project managers deliver solutions in time and with utmost customer satisfaction."

The paper proposes a methodology that enables the identification of SDM discipline quality categories and the evaluation of SDM disciplines’ net benefits. It advances the evaluation of software process quality from single quality category evaluation to multiple quality categories evaluation as proposed by the Kano model. An exploratory study was conducted to test the proposed methodology. The exploratory study results show that different types of Kano quality are present in individual SDM disciplines and that applications of individual SDM disciplines vary considerably in their relation to net benefits of IT projects. Consequently, software process quality evaluation models should start evaluating multiple categories of quality instead of just one and should not assume that the application of every individual SDM discipline has the same effect on the enterprise’s net benefits."

Based on the simulation results, the effectiveness of the negotiation mechanism is verified. We also analyzed the influence of maximum negotiation rounds and concession factors on the negotiation results."
Application of the Rayleigh Model to Predict Information Technology Program Cost and Schedule Performance,Systems Engineering in Context,,,,10.1007/978-3-030-00114-8_15,Rebekah YangJustin CoeBenjamin DryerMatthew CumpianMaeve BudiMatt PrebbleMary (Jocelyn) CoxShaelynn Hales,2019,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00114-8_15,Conference paper,"Analysis techniques based on statistical distributions can provide predictive metrics from historically observed trends in a program’s performance. The Rayleigh distribution is a continuous probability distribution that has been historically demonstrated to accurately model large-scale research and development and software development projects. This distribution is the basis of the Rayleigh model, whose shape works particularly well for forecasting software development projects because it can account for the slow ramp-up, peak spending as complexity increases, and a gradual tail-off toward completion. The Rayleigh model relies on accurate and consistent cost and schedule data to fit the distribution, but, because the model is used to fit data that are already collected through traditional project management techniques, there is relatively low additional effort required to realize program benefits, such as early warning of cost overruns and schedule slip. In this study, the predictive ability of the Rayleigh model in evaluating the spending profiles of civil agency IT development programs were evaluated. Using software developed previously by CNA, one completed and one ongoing IT program were analyzed using the Rayleigh model. The predictive ability of the Rayleigh model to estimate final program cost was compared to that of traditional earned value management system (EVMS) methods, with the former found to show earlier and consistent, but more exaggerated, warning indications of cost and schedule slippage. Overall, the Rayleigh model has potential to provide added value to IT program management, especially toward the beginning of a project, when used alongside traditional EVMS metrics."

Nowadays, the construction industry is already a pillar industry in China’s economic development. It keeps China’s economy growing rapidly in recent years. Therefore, China is gradually increasing its investment in construction projects. However, the construction project has the characteristics of large scale, long construction period, high cost, many stakeholders, and complex technology. Besides, it has obvious social characteristics. Therefore, construction projects lack of sociological perspective to analyze the problem of the project organization. Based on the characteristics of the construction project, this paper studies the organizational structure of the project, and analyzes the main application of the social network analysis method in the project. At the same time, this paper applies the social network analysis method to the actual construction project, constructs the social network model, makes a quantitative analysis of the model by using Ucinet software, and studies the application way of social network analysis method in the organization and management of construction projects."

Automation and Cognitive Systems are widely regarded as the foundation for improving the productivity as well as the quality of Service Delivery. At the same time, Hybrid IT deployments are being subject to a variety of challenges in large deployments on a global scale. Based on our experience of running a service practice that delivers IT Service Management in Hybrid IT environments to customers worldwide, this paper will review the challenges and directions in implementing Integrated Network, Systems and Service Management technologies and point out gaps encountered in current tools and implementations. This is fueled by the desire of Service Providers to evolve Automation from a development activity to an approach focusing on recording and storing the practices of the best system administrators and further on to a cognitive activity where the management system learns over time which actions need to be undertaken under a given set of circumstances. By means of real-life examples, we identify candidate concepts and technologies that will help us build the next generation of Integrated Network, Systems and Service Management."
Algorithms for estimating truck factors: a comparative study,Software Quality Journal,,,,10.1007/s11219-019-09457-2,Mívian FerreiraThaís MombachMarco Tulio ValenteKecia Ferreira,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-019-09457-2,Article,"Software development is a knowledge-intensive industry. For this reason, concentration of knowledge in software projects tends to be very risky, which increases the relevance of strategies that reveal how source code knowledge is distributed among team members. The truck factor (also known as the bus factor) is an increasingly popular concept—proposed by practitioners—that indicates the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or leave the team) before a project is incapacitated. Therefore, it is a measure that reveals the concentration of knowledge and the key developers in a project. Due to the importance of this concept, algorithms have been proposed to automatically compute truck factors, using maintenance activity data extracted from version control systems. However, we still lack large studies that assess the results of truck factor algorithms. To fulfill this gap in the literature, this paper describes the results of three empirical studies. In the first study, we validate the results produced by three algorithms to estimate truck factors. To this purpose, we build an oracle of truck factors, gathered via a survey with 35 open-source project teams. In the second study, we provide a comparison between truck factors and core developers, a related concept commonly used to denote the key developers of open-source projects. Our results indicate that truck factor developers are in most cases a subset of core developers. Finally, as the algorithms proposed so far are based in commit data, in the third study, we investigate other factors that may impact the computation of truck factors."
From Agile to DevOps: Smart Skills and Collaborations,Information Systems Frontiers,,,,10.1007/s10796-019-09905-1,Aymeric HemonBarbara LyonnetFrantz RoweBrian Fitzgerald,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10796-019-09905-1,Article,"Although agile software development approaches have become increasingly prevalent, many organizations, have found they were not able to achieve a more frequent release cadence, largely due to different departmental functions operating in silos. In an effort to remove these silos, companies have moved towards DevOps. As digitalization continues, companies increasingly implement DevOps. We suggest three different stages in the agile to DevOps transition: agile, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. Based on an in-depth case study in an organization with several years’ experience in DevOps, we identify a fundamental disruption in the soft skills that software teams are expected to possess, and in the patterns of collaboration among teams. Arguably, smartness may be characterized as being flexible, teaming up with people who have a different profile, belonging to a different function, and achieving a quicker delivery schedule. In light of this, we argue that DevOps leads to greater smartness for the Information Systems function."

Instead, we show that decisions that people make are at least as much important as process methodologies and techniques and helping employees make better decisions will benefit a company."
A novel fuzzy mechanism for risk assessment in software projects,Soft Computing,,,,10.1007/s00500-019-03997-2,K. SureshR. Dillibabu,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-019-03997-2,Article,"Risk management is a vital factor for ensuring better quality software development processes. Moreover, risks are the events that could adversely affect the organization activities or the development of projects. Effective prioritization of software project risks play a significant role in determining whether the project will be successful in terms of performance characteristics or not. In this work, we develop a new hybrid fuzzy-based machine learning mechanism for performing risk assessment in software projects. This newly developed hybridized risk assessment scheme can be used to determine and rank the significant software project risks that support the decision making during the software project lifecycle. For better assessment of the software project risks, we have incorporated fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-based multi-criteria decision making (ANFIS MCDM) and intuitionistic fuzzy-based TODIM (IF-TODIM) approaches. More significantly, for the newly introduced ANFIS MCDM approach, the parameters of ANFIS are adjusted using a traditional crow search algorithm (CSA) which applies only a reasonable as well as small changes in variables. The main activity of CSA in ANFIS is to find the best parameter to achieve most accurate software risk estimate. Experimental validation was conducted on NASA 93 dataset having 93 software project values. The result of this method exhibits a vivid picture that provides software risk factors that are key determinant for achievement of the project performance. Experimental outcomes reveal that our proposed integrated fuzzy approaches can exhibit better and accurate performance in the assessment of software project risks compared to other existing approaches."

As one of the most prominent characteristics of research in AI 2.0 era, crowd intelligence has attracted much attention from both industry and research communities. Specifically, crowd intelligence provides a novel problem-solving paradigm through gathering the intelligence of crowds to address challenges. In particular, due to the rapid development of the sharing economy, crowd intelligence not only becomes a new approach to solving scientific challenges, but has also been integrated into all kinds of application scenarios in daily life, e.g., online-to-offline (O2O) application, real-time traffic monitoring, and logistics management. In this paper, we survey existing studies of crowd intelligence. First, we describe the concept of crowd intelligence, and explain its relationship to the existing related concepts, e.g., crowdsourcing and human computation. Then, we introduce four categories of representative crowd intelligence platforms. We summarize three core research problems and the state-of-the-art techniques of crowd intelligence. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions of crowd intelligence."

Towards Quantitative Evaluation of Reuse Within Safety-Oriented Process Lines,"Systems, Software and Services Process Improvement",,,,10.1007/978-3-319-97925-0_40,Barbara GallinaShankar Iyer,2018,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-97925-0_40,Conference paper,"Recently, Safety-oriented Process Line Engineering (SoPLE) has been proposed as a sound solution to systematize reuse in the context of safety-oriented processes described within safety-related standards. Currently, however, no metrics have been used to measure the actual gain in terms of reuse that the application of this engineering method entails. To overcome this lack of quantitative evidence, we adopt the GQM $$^{+}$$ Strategies model, an extension of the Goal/Question/Metric (GQM) paradigm, for measurements. After having defined our specific measurement goals, we build on top of existing metrics, defined for measuring product-related reuse, and we translate them in our semantic space to evaluate our goals. We then apply our GQM $$^{+}$$ Strategies model on a ECSS-compliant SoPL to illustrate and assess its usefulness."

This paper presents a new hybrid algorithm; called Learning Cuckoo Search (LCS) strategy based on the integration student phase from Teaching Learning based Optimization (TLBO) Algorithm. To evaluate the developed algorithm, we use the problem of t-way test generation as our case study. The experiment results show that LCS has better performance as compared as to the original Cuckoo Search as well many other existing strategies."

The flexibility and reactiveness of start-ups enables fast development and launch of innovative products. However, a majority of software start-up companies fail before achieving any success. Among other factors, poor software engineering could be a significant contributor to the challenges experienced by start-ups. However, the state-of-practice of software engineering in start-ups, as well as the utilization of state-of-the-art is largely an unexplored area. Objective In this study we investigate how software engineering is applied in start-up context with a focus to identify key knowledge areas and opportunities for further research. Method We perform a multi-vocal exploratory study of 88 start-up experience reports. We develop a custom taxonomy to categorize the reported software engineering practices and their interrelation with business aspects, and apply qualitative data analysis to explore influences and dependencies between the knowledge areas. Results We identify the most frequently reported software engineering (requirements engineering, software design and quality) and business aspect (vision and strategy development) knowledge areas, and illustrate their relationships. We also present a summary of how relevant software engineering knowledge areas are implemented in start-ups and identify potentially useful practices for adoption in start-ups. Conclusions The results enable a more focused research on engineering practices in start-ups. We conclude that most engineering challenges in start-ups stem from inadequacies in requirements engineering. Many promising practices to address specific engineering challenges exists, however more research on adaptation of established practices, and validation of new start-up specific practices is needed."

This paper utilises the results of a research study that focused on the training of the project management methodology PRINCE2 in an organisation where IT was one of the departments. The longitudinal study over two and a half years reported on the adoption of the PRINCE2 project management methodology by sixteen employees following the successful completion of a PRINCE2 training course. Two different outcomes were observed: some individuals continued to develop their interest in PRINCE2 and looked for a stable network that will support their practice, even if they resigned from the organisation. The other outcome was that other individuals ceased using PRINCE2 for their projects if there was no imperative given by the organisation to use it and no example set by others in using it. The adoption outcomes from this study have implications as to the interventions that need to be implemented by organisations to derive the value from an investment in professional vocational education in project management for all relevant professionals."
From Buzz to Burst—Critical Remarks on the Term ‘Life’ and Its Ethical Implications in Synthetic Biology,NanoEthics,,,,10.1007/s11569-019-00361-4,Michael FunkJohannes SteizingerDaniel FalknerTobias Eichinger,2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11569-019-00361-4,Article,"In this paper, we examine the use of the term ‘life’ in the debates within and about synthetic biology. We review different positions within these debates, focusing on the historical background, the constructive epistemology of laboratory research and the pros and cons of metaphorical speech. We argue that ‘life’ is used as buzzword, as folk concept, and as theoretical concept in inhomogeneous ways. Extending beyond the review of the significant literature, we also argue that ‘life’ can be understood as a Burstword in two concrete senses. Firstly, terms such as life easily turn into fuzzy, foggy and buzzy clouds of nonsense, if their use is not appropriately reflected. In these cases, the semantic orientation is detonated. This is the Burstword I characteristic of the concept of ‘life’ that we reveal for its unclear terminological use. Secondly, and in contrast to Burstword I , we show that the concept of ‘life’ can be used in a methodologically controlled way. We call this kind of use Burstword II . Here the concept of ‘life’ fulfils the function of expanding an inadequately narrow disciplinary or conceptual focus in different discursive contexts. In this second sense, ‘life’ receives an important operational function, for instance as a transdisciplinary research principle. It turns out that the innovative function and paradigm-changing power of metaphorical speech belong here as well. Finally, we illustrate three ethically relevant examples that show how ‘life’ can be applied as Burstword II in the context of synthetic biology."

Various key performance indicators of the project were determined via documentary analysis and a series of in-depth interviews with the senior representatives of the key project stakeholders. Useful insights can be generated according to the hands-on experience derived from this trial project to the potential users of NEC3 ECC in the construction industry from other countries, in particular those where NEC3 ECC has not yet been adopted. The case study findings would benefit both the construction academics and industrial practitioners in elucidating the project performance of a real-life case study of applying NEC3 ECC in the East, providing more empirical evidence in the growing body of knowledge and developing a strong basis for future research such as an international comparison of project performance of NEC3 ECC construction projects between the East and the West."

Frameworks such as PRINCE2^® and ITIL^® are key players in the project management and service management arena. The definitions of models for these frameworks are high-level indicating a lack of formal semantics which can readily result in ambiguity between modeling solutions. Manual interventions by humans to produce models out of such frameworks are error prone. MDA has been at the forefront of research in an attempt to resolve issues faced by the software development community. The proposition by the authors is the transfer of practices applied within the MDA domain to that of business-oriented frameworks and more specifically project management in order to improve corporate decision making.

Thus, research is needed to guide universities in strategically examining learners, academic staffs and management adoption of BL. Accordingly, this study develops a model to facilitate university policy makers in their decision making to assess students learning and academic staffs teaching outcome. Furthermore, this study explores on the factors that influence BL adoption in universities, through an empirical study from the perspectives of learners, academic staffs, and management. In particular, it examines the current BL practice adoption effectiveness in universities. Based on extensive review of prior studies, survey questionnaires was designed and distributed to convenience samples of 87 students, academic staffs, and management in 3 Malaysia universities to validate the developed model. Next, Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyze the survey data. Findings reveal that supportive factors, attitude, learning mode, satisfaction, course management, and ease of use positively predict the perception of learners and academic staffs’ to adopt BL. Similarly, findings suggest that the perception of management towards BL adoption is positively determined by the strategy, structure, and support factors. Moreover, findings reveal that the impact of BL on learners’ effectiveness is positively predicted by achievement, engagement, involvement, retention, and cognitive outcome. Additionally, findings suggest that the impact BL on academic staffs’ effectiveness is significantly influence by delivery, performance, evaluation, motivation. Theoretical implications from this study contribute to enhance teaching quality by enriching course management, improving learning content, and facilitate management policies towards effective BL adoption."

In managing teamwork, decisions are often made under uncertainty and resource constraints. The strategies and the effectiveness of the strategies different people adopt to manage teamwork under different situations have not yet been fully explored, partially due to a lack of detailed large-scale data. In this paper, we describe a multi-faceted large-scale dataset to bridge this gap. It is derived from a game simulating complex project management processes. It presents the participants with different conditions in terms of team members’ capabilities and task characteristics for them to exhibit their decision-making strategies. The dataset contains detailed data reflecting the decision situations, decision strategies, decision outcomes, and the emotional responses of 1,144 participants from diverse backgrounds. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset simultaneously covering these four facets of decision-making. With repeated measurements, the dataset may help establish baseline variability of decision-making in teamwork management, leading to more realistic decision theoretic models and more effective decision support approaches."

It is more beneficial to build a common infrastructure to connect, aggregate and utilize all these services. In this paper, a Smart Citizen Fusion Service Platform Software Product Line, called CrowdService, is introduced as a solution. Based on open data, crowd sourcing, user profile and application framework, the architecture of CrowdService supports the development of personalized applications in smart cities. It consists of resource gathering components, open API component, PAAS components, service recommendation, etc. which supports rapid development of personalized applications in different cities. In terms of system management, CrowdService provides minimized total product development cost, increased productivity, on-time delivery, full control over all lifecycles, decreased defect rate both in assets and products, compliance on mission focus, architectural conformance, process compliance, high quality and customer satisfaction. Moreover, our one practice of smart citizen fusion service platform in China is introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CrowdService."

Using Nonlinear Quantile Regression for the Estimation of Software Cost,Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems,,,,10.1007/978-3-319-92639-1_35,J. De AndrésM. LandajoP. Lorca,2018,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-92639-1_35,Conference paper,"Estimation of effort costs is an important task for the management of software development projects. Researchers have followed two approaches –namely, statistical/machine-learning and theory-based– which explicitly rely on mean/median regression lines in order to model the relationship between software size and effort. Those approaches share a common drawback deriving from their inability to properly incorporate risk attitudes in the presence of heteroskedasticity. We propose a more flexible quantile regression approach that enables risk aversion to be incorporated in a systematic way, with the higher order conditional quantiles of the relationship between project size and effort being used to represent more risk adverse decision makers. A cubic quantile regression model allows consideration of economies/diseconomies of scale. The method is illustrated with an empirical application to a database of real projects. Results suggest that the shapes of higher order regression quantiles may sharply differ from that of the conditional median, revealing that the naive expedient of translating or multiplying some average norm (adding a safety margin to median estimates or including a multiplicative correction factor) is a potentially biased way to consider risk aversion. The proposed approach enables a more realistic analysis, adapted to the specificities of software development databases."

However, when applying such a method in education field, several design questions about why, what, when, who, where and how to adopt such method should be clarified and elaborated. In this paper, we introduce our successful applications of the crowd-based method in software engineering course for undergraduates. We design an organization structure consisting of “small-core crowd” and “large-external crowd” for our course projects in which both learners and crowds on Internet work together to contribute their wisdoms. Two kinds of wisdoms of crowds are exploited in our practices. One is the high-quality open source software (OSS) developed by crowds on the Internet, the other is the diverse software development issues, knowledges, experiences, expertise, etc., that are discussed and interacted by crowds in OSS communities and course communities. We design several course practice activities to exploit crowds’ wisdoms, including reading high-quality OSS, searching and reusing OSS in course project, joining and getting helps from OSS communities. The results show that the crowd-based method applied in our software engineering course can significantly improve learner’s engineering capabilities of developing high-quality and large-scale software."

Project management certification is seen as a step towards the professionalisation of the discipline. Certifications were developed as a means to provide individuals with the appropriate knowledge and skills required to deliver projects successfully. Although project management certification programmes are now commonplace across the globe, research is yet to fully investigate the true influence certifications have on project performance. This paper revealed that South African IT project performance is not influenced by project management certification. Moreover, it was established that certifications need to be redesigned to ensure that the professionalisation of project management remains on track."

First, we introduce IVIFS and its distance. Second, we introduce IVIFS method and its application to the classification of software project. Finally, we present a rule extraction model according to IVIFS fuzziness and its K-means clustering, and apply them to pattern classification of outsourced software project risk to demonstrate the advantages of this model. The experimental results show that the rules from IVIFS model are better than that from the conventional K-means clustering model in rule extraction, and the prediction effect from the former is more effective than that from the latter. According to this combinational rule extraction method, based on database from a special and professional investigation for Chinese small and medium software-outsourced enterprise, we obtain some valuable, realistic and available project development risks decision rules."

Scheduling results can be optimized by considering Quality of Service (QoS) parameters as inherent requirements of scheduling. In existing literature, only a few resource scheduling algorithms have considered cost and execution time constraints but efficient scheduling requires better optimization of QoS parameters. The main aim of this research paper is to present an efficient strategy for execution of workloads on cloud resources. A particle swarm optimization based resource scheduling technique has been designed named as BULLET which is used to execute workloads effectively on available resources. Performance of the proposed technique has been evaluated in cloud environment. The experimental results show that the proposed technique efficiently reduces execution cost, time and energy consumption along with other QoS parameters."

Towards improving decision making and estimating the value of decisions in value-based software engineering: the VALUE framework,Software Quality Journal,,,,10.1007/s11219-017-9360-z,Emilia MendesPilar RodriguezVitor FreitasSimon BakerMohamed Amine Atoui,2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-017-9360-z,Article,"To sustain growth, maintain competitive advantage and to innovate, companies must make a paradigm shift in which both short- and long-term value aspects are employed to guide their decision-making. Such need is clearly pressing in innovative industries, such as ICT, and is also the core of Value-based Software Engineering (VBSE). The goal of this paper is to detail a framework called VALUE—improving decision-making relating to software-intensive products and services development—and to show its application in practice to a large ICT company in Finland. The VALUE framework includes a mixed-methods approach, as follows: to elicit key stakeholders’ tacit knowledge regarding factors used during a decision-making process, either transcripts from interviews with key stakeholders are analysed and validated in focus group meetings or focus-group meeting(s) are directly applied. These value factors are later used as input to a Web-based tool (Value tool) employed to support decision making. This tool was co-created with four industrial partners in this research via a design science approach that includes several case studies and focus-group meetings. Later, data on key stakeholders’ decisions gathered using the Value tool, plus additional input from key stakeholders, are used, in combination with the Expert-based Knowledge Engineering of Bayesian Network (EKEBN) process, coupled with the weighed sum algorithm (WSA) method, to build and validate a company-specific value estimation model. The application of our proposed framework to a real case, as part of an ongoing collaboration with a large software company (company A), is presented herein. Further, we also provide a detailed example, partially using real data on decisions, of a value estimation Bayesian network (BN) model for company A. This paper presents some empirical results from applying the VALUE Framework to a large ICT company; those relate to eliciting key stakeholders’ tacit knowledge, which is later used as input to a pilot study where these stakeholders employ the Value tool to select features for one of their company’s chief products. The data on decisions obtained from this pilot study is later applied to a detailed example on building a value estimation BN model for company A. We detail a framework—VALUE framework—to be used to help companies improve their value-based decisions and to go a step further and also estimate the overall value of each decision."
