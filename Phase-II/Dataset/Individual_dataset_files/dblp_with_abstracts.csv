Within this dynamic context, access control policies are critical for ensuring the security of systems by defining who can access specific resources under given conditions. However, identifying and documenting these policies often rely on manual, time-intensive processes prone to errors and oversight. This paper proposes an innovative framework leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the extraction and organization of access control policies from user stories and software documentation. The framework focuses on the early stages of the development lifecycle, capturing access control requirements as expressed in natural language artifacts. It comprises two core components: 1) a pipeline for extracting and categorizing access control policies, enabling precise mappings between roles, actions, and resources, and 2) an interactive chatbot designed to support Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts in evaluating suspicious access requests by providing contextualized insights into access policies. By integrating advanced natural language processing techniques with retrieval-based augmentation, the framework aims to reinforce access control mechanisms by improving visibility, and providing contextualized insights for security analysts."

Understanding these properties is crucial, especially for researchers investigating language model capabilities, employing embeddings for tasks related to text similarity, or evaluating the reasons behind token importance as measured through attribution methods. Applications for embedding exploration frequently involve dimensionality reduction techniques, which reduce high‐dimensional vectors to two dimensions used as coordinates in a scatterplot. This data transformation step introduces uncertainty that can be propagated to the visual representation and influence users' interpretation of the data. To communicate such uncertainties, we present <jats:bold>LayerFlow</jats:bold> – a visual analytics workspace that displays embeddings in an interlinked projection design and communicates the transformation, representation, and interpretation uncertainty. In particular, to hint at potential data distortions and uncertainties, the workspace includes several visual components, such as convex hulls showing 2D and HD clusters, data point pairwise distances, cluster summaries, and projection quality metrics. We show the usability of the presented workspace through replication and expert case studies that highlight the need to communicate uncertainty through multiple visual components and different data perspectives."

However, processing these data streams to determine fire weather indices presents challenges, underscoring the growing importance of effective forest fire detection. This paper discusses using Apache Spark for early forest fire detection, enhancing fire risk prediction with meteorological and geographical data. Building on our previous development of Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontologies and Semantic Web Rules Language (SWRL) for managing forest fires in Monesterial Natural Park, we expanded SWRL to improve a Decision Support System (DSS) using a Large Language Models (LLMs) and Spark framework. We implemented real-time alerts with Spark streaming, tailored to various fire scenarios, and validated our approach using ontology metrics, query-based evaluations, LLMs score precision, F1 score, and recall measures."

It allows the 6G management and orchestration framework to operate the networks without external (e.g., human) intervention. To effectively achieve ZSM, advanced network management procedures are required to detect and resolve anomalies within the 6G network autonomously, which usually requires artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models. However, relying solely on AI can raise concerns about trust due to their lack of explainability. Indeed, as these models are not explainable, it is difficult to understand and trust their decisions. To overcome this limitation, this article introduces a novel pipeline for ensuring trustworthy ZSM in 6G networks by combining AI for detecting anomalies; eXplainable AI (XAI) to identify the root causes of anomalies using feature importance analysis; and large language models (LLMs) to generate user-friendly explanations and suggest/apply corrective actions to resolve anomalies. A use case is presented using XGBoost as AI, SHAP as XAI, and Llama2 as LLM to address service level agreement (SLA) latency violations within cloud-native 6G microservices. Evaluation results obtained through real experiments demonstrate the framework's efficiency in scaling cloud resources to prevent SLA violations while providing understandable explanations to users, thereby enhancing trust in the system."

The research aims to explore the influence of social communication on citizens’ behavior using large language model services and assess its effectiveness. The paper builds on Daniel Kahneman’s dual-process theory, highlighting the intuitive system (System 1) and the rational system (System 2) in decision-making. The author introduces a third system, System 3, representing rooted in identity socially conditioned behavior influenced by societal norms and self-awareness. On this theoretical basis, the paper emphasizes automating communication management through large language model services, freeing up citizens’ potential for self-determination and self-organization. By leveraging these services, messages can be crafted to support social transformation while respecting historical, cultural, and political contexts. Based on the preconditions and restrictions described above, we use GPT-4 model to generate messages based on these narratives. The experiment will use an observational study design with virtual persons. To compare the impact of original and modified messages according to the addressee’s mentality, we used the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model. We can see that the potential activity of respondents after perceiving the changed message does not change much, and the original message is perceived. Modifying messages by LLM services crafted to support social transformation while respecting historical, cultural, and political contexts cause attitudes to become substantially more negative (2.5 units downward shift in median); the intentions showed a slight positive increase (0.2 units upward change in median)."

The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has further elevated multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as essential tools for managing and optimizing healthcare data in IoMT. MLLMs can handle multimodal inputs and generate different kinds of data by utilizing large-scale training on massive multimodal datasets. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain in developing medical MLLMs, especially security and data freshness concerns, which impact the quality of MLLM outputs. To this end, this article proposes a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-empowered medical MLLM framework for healthcare data management. The proposed framework enables secure data training by utilizing a hierarchical cross-chain design. Furthermore, it improves the output quality of MLLMs by using hybrid RAG that filters different unimodal RAG results using multimodal metrics and integrates these retrieval results as additional inputs for MLLMs. Furthermore, we utilize the age of information (AoI) to indirectly assess the influence of data freshness on MLLMs and apply contract theory to motivate healthcare data stakeholders to disseminate their current data, thereby alleviating information asymmetry in the data-sharing process. Finally, we employ a generative diffusion model-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to find the optimal contract for efficient data sharing. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving secure and efficient healthcare data management."

The software defects may lead to delays or crashes in flexible manufacturing system, thereby affecting the production schedule. Automated software defect localization based on code changes can significantly reduce development and maintenance time costs, thereby maintaining the competitive edge of flexible manufacturing in the IIoT. Current efforts in software defect localization are primarily based on deep learning models or information retrieval models. This article investigates the performance of large language models (LLMs) in software defect localization and optimizes localization accuracy by combining it with an information retrieval model. Our empirical study reveals that GPT, given a software defect description, is unable to determine whether specific code changes are relevant. The model is unable to provide accurate answers, which aligns with the generative nature of LLMs where responses are generated according to probability distributions. However, the combined framework of LLMs and information retrieval models proposed in this article outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on public datasets. We conclude that LLMs can enhance localization performance when used as side information in conjunction with existing information retrieval models. The effectiveness of the framework has been validated through experiments conducted on publicly available datasets and in practical applications within IIoT projects. This offers valuable insights into the application and development of LLMs for defect localization in the software development and maintenance processes in the IIoT flexible manufacturing."

However, long context training poses great challenges considering the constraint of GPU memory. It not only leads to substantial activation memory consumption during training, but also incurs considerable memory fragmentation. To facilitate long context training, existing frameworks have adopted strategies such as recomputation and various forms of parallelisms. Nevertheless, these techniques rely on redundant computation or extensive communication, resulting in low Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU). In this paper, we propose MEMO, a novel LLM training framework designed for fine-grained activation memory management. Given the quadratic scaling of computation and linear scaling of memory with sequence lengths when using FlashAttention, we offload memory-consuming activations to CPU memory after each layer's forward pass and fetch them during the backward pass. To maximize the swapping of activations without hindering computation, and to avoid exhausting limited CPU memory, we implement a token-wise activation recomputation and swapping mechanism. Furthermore, we tackle the memory fragmentation issue by employing a bi-level Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approach, optimizing memory reuse across transformer layers. Empirical results demonstrate that MEMO achieves an average of 1.97x and 1.80x MFU compared to Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed, respectively. This improvement is attributed to MEMO's ability to minimize memory fragmentation, reduce recomputation and intensive communication, and circumvent the delays associated with the memory reorganization process due to fragmentation. By leveraging fine-grained activation memory management, MEMO facilitates efficient training of 7B LLM with 1 million sequence length on just 8 A800 GPUs, achieving an MFU of 52.30%."

Despite its importance, executing the test suite of a project can be challenging in practice because different projects use different programming languages, software ecosystems, build systems, testing frameworks, and other tools. These challenges make it difficult to create a reliable, universal test execution method that works across different projects. This paper presents ExecutionAgent, an automated technique that prepares scripts for building an arbitrary project from source code and running its test cases. Inspired by the way a human developer would address this task, our approach is a large language model (LLM)-based agent that autonomously executes commands and interacts with the host system. The agent uses meta-prompting to gather guidelines on the latest technologies related to the given project, and it iteratively refines its process based on feedback from the previous steps. Our evaluation applies ExecutionAgent to 50 open-source projects that use 14 different programming languages and many different build and testing tools. The approach successfully executes the test suites of 33/50 projects, while matching the test results of ground truth test suite executions with a deviation of only 7.5%. These results improve over the best previously available technique by 6.6x. The costs imposed by the approach are reasonable, with an execution time of 74 minutes and LLM costs of USD 0.16, on average per project. We envision ExecutionAgent to serve as a valuable tool for developers, automated programming tools, and researchers that need to execute tests across a wide variety of projects."

These frameworks may be prone to bugs that can lead to crash or wrong results, particularly when involving complex model architectures and substantial computational demands. Such framework bugs can disrupt DL applications, impacting customer experience and potentially causing financial losses. Traditional approaches to testing DL frameworks face limitations in adapting to the vast search space of model structures, diverse APIs, and the complexity of hybrid programming and hardware environments. Recent advancements using Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved DL framework fuzzing, but their efficacy depends heavily on the quality and diversity of input prompts, which are often constructed using single-framework data.
 
 In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for enhancing test generation for DL frameworks by leveraging “mirroring issues”—analogous bugs identified across different frameworks with common functionalities. Our approach is inspired by the fact that DL frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, often share common bugs due to dependencies, developer errors, or edge-case inputs. We develop CrossProbe that utilizes LLMs to effectively learn from existing issues of one framework and transfer the acquired knowledge to generate test cases for finding mirroring issues in another framework, thus enabling cross-framework bug detection. To overcome the challenges of test case generation arising from the incompatible functionalities and different implementations between frameworks, we introduce three processes:
 alignment
 ,
 screening
 , and
 distinction
 . These processes help mitigate transfer errors by establishing API pair databases, filtering unsuitable cases, and highlighting cross-framework distinctions. Experiments demonstrate that CrossProbe is efficient by saving 36.3% iterations of generation, and achieves a 25.0% higher success rate in issue transferring compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based testing techniques. CrossProbe detects 24 unique bugs using its transferred knowledge. Out of them, 19 are previously unknown and each requires cross-framework knowledge in deep learning for identification.

However, assessing the quality of these LLM-generated code and text remains challenging. The commonly used Pass@k metric necessitates extensive unit tests and configured environments, demands a high labor cost, and is not suitable for evaluating LLM-generated text. Conventional metrics like BLEU, which measure only lexical rather than semantic similarity, have also come under scrutiny. In response, a new trend has emerged to employ LLMs for automated evaluation, known as LLM-as-a-judge. These LLM-as-a-judge methods are claimed to better mimic human assessment than conventional metrics without relying on high-quality reference answers. Nevertheless, their exact human alignment in SE tasks remains unexplored.
 In this paper, we empirically explore LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating SE tasks, focusing on their alignment with human judgments. We select seven LLM-as-a-judge methods that utilize general-purpose LLMs, alongside two LLMs specifically fine-tuned for evaluation. After generating and manually scoring LLM responses on three recent SE datasets of code translation, code generation, and code summarization, we then prompt these methods to evaluate each response. Finally, we compare the scores generated by these methods with human evaluation. The results indicate that output-based methods reach the highest Pearson correlation of 81.32 and 68.51 with human scores in code translation and generation, achieving near-human evaluation, noticeably outperforming ChrF++, one of the best conventional metrics, at 34.23 and 64.92. Such output-based methods prompt LLMs to output judgments directly, and exhibit more balanced score distributions that resemble human score patterns. Finally, we provide insights and implications, concluding that current state-of-the-art LLM-as-a-judge methods can potentially replace human evaluations in certain SE tasks."

More recently, researchers and industry practitioners have developed various autonomous LLM agents to perform end-to-end software development tasks. These agents are equipped with the ability to use tools, run commands, observe feedback from the environment, and plan for future actions. However, the complexity of these agent-based approaches, together with the limited abilities of current LLMs, raises the following question: Do we really have to employ complex autonomous software agents? To attempt to answer this question, we build Agentless – an agentless approach to automatically resolve software development issues. Compared to the verbose and complex setup of agent-based approaches, Agentless employs a simplistic three-phase process of localization, repair, and patch validation, without letting the LLM decide future actions or operate with complex tools. Our results on the popular SWE-bench Lite benchmark show that surprisingly the simplistic Agentless is able to achieve both the highest performance (32.00%, 96 correct fixes) and low cost ($0.70) compared with all existing open-source software agents at the time of paper submission! Agentless also achieves more than 50% solve rate when using Claude 3.5 Sonnet on the new SWE-bench Verified benchmark. In fact, Agentless has already been adopted by OpenAI as the go-to approach to showcase the real-world coding performance of both GPT-4o and the new o1 models; more recently, Agentless has also been used by DeepSeek to evaluate their newest DeepSeek V3 and R1 models. Furthermore, we manually classified the problems in SWE-bench Lite and found problems with exact ground truth patches or insufficient/misleading issue descriptions. As such, we construct SWE-bench Lite-𝑆 by excluding such problematic issues to perform more rigorous evaluation and comparison. Our work highlights the currently overlooked potential of a simplistic, cost-effective technique in autonomous software development. We hope Agentless will help reset the baseline, starting point, and horizon for autonomous software agents, and inspire future work along this crucial direction.

However, automating the building process for C/C++ projects is a highly complex endeavor, involving tremendous technical challenges, such as intricate dependency management, diverse build systems, varied toolchains, and multifaceted error handling mechanisms. Consequently, building C/C++ projects often proves to be difficult in practice, hindering the progress of downstream applications. Unfortunately, research on facilitating the building of C/C++ projects remains to be inadequate. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers promising solutions to automated software building. Trained on extensive corpora, LLMs can help unify diverse build systems through their comprehension capabilities and address complex errors by leveraging tacit knowledge storage. Moreover, LLM-based agents can be systematically designed to dynamically interact with the environment, effectively managing dynamic building issues. Motivated by these opportunities, we first conduct an empirical study to systematically analyze the current challenges in the C/C++ project building process. Particularly, we observe that most popular C/C++ projects encounter an average of five errors when relying solely on the default build systems. Based on our study, we develop an automated build system called CXXCrafter to specifically address the above-mentioned challenges, such as dependency resolution. Our evaluation on open-source software demonstrates that CXXCrafter achieves a success rate of 78% in project building. Specifically, among the Top100 dataset, 72 projects are built successfully by both CXXCrafter and manual efforts, 3 by CXXCrafter only, and 14 manually only. Despite the slightly lower performance,CXXCrafter can save tremendous manual efforts and can also be easily applied to a wider range of applications automatically."

Our approach splits up the area into various local regions and an LLM agent handles each one of them intelligently in reasoning and decision making. We present some novel designs in our system: 1) Adaptive region management and allocation to regions, supporting the dynamic partitioning of different complexity or density areas. 2) The multi-level LLM-driven agents collaboration framework that enables peer-peer, interLLM coordination and controls for effective monitoring intelligence across a hierarchical path planning organization hierarchy level ensures autonomy whilst improving overall understanding among LLM agents, leading to more accurate planning decisions from real-time analysis. (3) Failurereflection- replanning mechanism integrated within an individual LLM's management scope eventually results continual improvement. (4) LLM agents can do function calling to interact with the typical algorithms also. Our system successfully processes complex and large-scale MAPF scenarios by merging the higher-orderality of reasoning capabilities in LLMs with this novel distributed framework. For instance, the distributed and hierarchical nature of this approach helps to break a high-dimensional MAPF problem into several groups of smaller dimension. As such, this approach also opens up the development of AI language models in more complex robotics and logistics scenarios, potentially changing how multi-agent coordination is done for actual situations."

High-TVL smart contracts often require complex numerical computations, particularly in mathematical financial models used by many decentralized applications (DApps). Improper calculations can introduce numerical defects, posing potential security risks. Existing research primarily focuses on traditional numerical defects like integer overflow, and there is currently a lack of systematic research and effective detection methods targeting new types of numerical defects. In this paper, we identify five new types of numerical defects through the analysis of 1,199 audit reports by utilizing the open card method. Each defect is defined and illustrated with a code example to highlight its features and potential consequences. We also propose NumScout, a symbolic execution-based tool designed to detect these five defects. Specifically, the tool combines information from source code and bytecode, analyzing key operations such as comparisons and transfers, to effectively locate defects and report them based on predefined detection patterns. Furthermore, NumScout uses a large language model (LLM) to prune functions which are unrelated to numerical operations. This step allows symbolic execution to quickly enter the target function and improve runtime speed by 28.4%. We run NumScout on 6,617 real-world contracts and evaluated its performance based on manually labeled results. We find that 1,774 contracts contained at least one of the five defects, and the tool achieved an overall precision of 89.7%."

The basic idea is to delegate to an LLM the assessment of the “quality” of the output provided by an automated technique (often another LLM) for tasks for which: (i) quantitative metrics would only tell part of the story, and; (ii) a large-scale human-based evaluation would be too expensive. LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can also unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a solution for a given instance of the task (<italic>e.g.,</italic> an answer to a question) and others judging and deciding what is the best output to show the user. We study the effectiveness of LLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely <italic>code generation</italic> and <italic>code summarization</italic>. The rationale for choosing these tasks is two-fold. First, quantitative metrics are usually not enough for the assessment of code summarizers/generators. For example, it is well documented that metrics such as BLEU are quite weak proxies for the quality of the generated summaries. Second, even state-of-the-art techniques still struggle with handling complex instances of these tasks (<italic>e.g.,</italic> summarizing a quite long / complex function), making them good candidates for benefiting from more advanced solutions envisioning collaboration among LLMs. For <italic>code generation</italic>, we check whether eight LLMs are able to judge the correctness of 1,405 Java methods and 1,281 Python functions generated by the same LLMs or implemented by humans. For <italic>code summarization</italic>, we compare the judgment of five LLMs to those provided by ninehumans for <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\sim$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math><graphic position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" xlink:href=""bavota-ieq1-3586082.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula> 1.2k summaries, related to both Java and Python functions. Our findings show that GPT-4-turbo is the best LLM in terms of judging capabilities for both tasks, with “smaller” LLMs featuring tens of billions parameters not being able to cope with judging tasks. However, even the best-performing LLM frequently misjudges the correctness of the code and summary quality."

To mitigate hallucinations caused by large context during input processing, we introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to be syntactically simple and compositional. This design allows the LLM to learn and generate test scenarios in a modular manner while enabling syntactic and semantic validation for each component. Based on these validated representations, TARGET synthesizes executable scripts to render scenarios in simulation. Evaluated seven ADSs with 284 scenarios derived from 54 traffic rules, TARGET uncovered 610 rule violations, collisions, and other issues. For each violation, TARGET generates scenario recordings and detailed logs, aiding root cause analysis. Two identified issues were confirmed by ADS developers: one linked to an existing bug report and the other to limited ADS functionality."

We propose ChatAssert, a prompt engineering framework designed for oracle generation that uses dynamic and static information to iteratively refine prompts for querying large language models (LLMs). ChatAssert uses code summaries and examples to assist an LLM in generating candidate test oracles, uses a lightweight static analysis to assist the LLM in repairing generated oracles that fail to compile, and uses dynamic information obtained from test runs to help the LLM in repairing oracles that compile but do not pass. Experimental results using an independent publicly-available dataset show that ChatAssert improves the state-of-the-art technique, teco, on key evaluation metrics. For example, it improves Acc@1 by 15%. Overall, results provide initial yet strong evidence that using external tools in the formulation of prompts is an important aid in LLM-based oracle generation."

However, the massive pretraining code data is not rigorously filtered, allowing LLMs to learn unsafe coding patterns. Several prior studies have demonstrated that code LLMs tend to generate code with potential vulnerabilities. The widespread adoption of intelligent programming assistants poses a significant threat to the software development process. Existing approaches to mitigating this risk primarily involve constructing secure data that are free of vulnerabilities and then retraining or fine-tuning the models. However, such an effort is resource intensive and requires significant manual supervision. When the model parameters are too large (e.g., more than 1 billion) or multiple models with the same parameter scale have the same optimization needs (e.g., to avoid outputting vulnerable code), the above work will become unaffordable. To address this challenge, in previous work, we proposed CoSec, an approach to improve the security of code LLMs with different parameters by utilizing an independent and very small parametric security model as a decoding navigator. Despite CoSec’s excellent performance, we found that there is still room for improving: 1) its ability to maintain the functional correctness of hardened targets, and 2) the security of the generated code. To address the above issues, we propose CoSec+, a hardening framework consisting of three phases: 1) Functional Correctness Alignment, which improves the functional correctness of the security base with knowledge disstillation; 2) Security Training, which yields an independent, but much smaller security model; and 3) Co-decoding, where the security model iteratively reasons about the next token along with the target model. Due to the higher confidence that a well-trained security model places in secure and correct tokens, it guides the target base model to generate more secure code, even as it improves the functional correctness of the target base model. We have conducted extensive experiments in several code LLMs (i.e., CodeGen, StarCoderBase, DeepSeekCoder and Qwen2.5-Coder), and the results show that our approach is effective in improving the functional correctness and security of the models. The evaluation results show that CoSec+ can deliver a 0.8% to 37.7% improvement in security across models of various parameter sizes and families; moreover, it preserves the functional correctness of the target base models—achieving functional-correctness gains of 0.7% to 51.1% for most of those models."

With the strong capabilities of code comprehension, the recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in diagnosing bugs in the code. Nevertheless, due to LLMs’ limited performance in handling long contexts, existing LLM-based fault localization remains on localizing bugs within a small code scope (i.e., a method or a class), which struggles to diagnose bugs for a large code scope (i.e., an entire software system). To address the limitation, this paper presents SoapFL, which builds an LLM-driven standard operating procedure (SOP) to automatically localize buggy methods from the entire software. By simulating the behavior of a human developer, SoapFL models the FL task as a three-step process, which involves comprehension, navigation, and confirmation. Within specific steps, SoapFL provides useful test behavior or coverage information to LLM through program analysis. Particularly, we adopt a series of auxiliary strategies such as Test Behavior Tracking, Document-Guided Search, and Multi-Round Dialogue to overcome the challenges in each step. The evaluation on the widely used Defects4J-V1.2.0 benchmark shows that SoapFL can localize 175 out of 395 bugs within Top-1, which outperforms the other LLM-based approaches and exhibits complementarity to the state-of-the-art learning-based techniques. Additionally, we confirm the indispensability of the components in SoapFL with the ablation study and demonstrate the usability of SoapFL through a user study. Finally, the cost analysis shows that SoapFL spends an average of only 0.081 dollars and 92 seconds for a single bug."

Most existing approaches for mutation testing involve the application of a fixed set of mutation operators, e.g., replacing a “+” with a “-”, or removing a function’s body. However, certain types of real-world bugs cannot easily be simulated by such approaches, limiting their effectiveness. This paper presents a technique for mutation testing where placeholders are introduced at designated locations in a program’s source code and where a Large Language Model (LLM) is prompted to ask what they could be replaced with. The technique is implemented in LLMorpheus, a mutation testing tool for JavaScript, and evaluated on 13 subject packages, considering several variations on the prompting strategy, and using several LLMs. We find LLMorpheus to be capable of producing mutants that resemble existing bugs that cannot be produced by StrykerJS, a state-of-the-art mutation testing tool. Moreover, we report on the running time, cost, and number of mutants produced by LLMorpheus, demonstrating its practicality."

COSMIC measurement is a manual task that requires qualified professionals and effort. To support professionals in COSMIC measurement, we propose an automatic approach, CosMet, that leverages Large Language Models to measure software size starting from use cases specified in natural language. To evaluate the proposed approach, we developed a web tool that implements CosMet using GPT-4 and conducted two studies to assess the approach quantitatively and qualitatively. Initially, we experimented with CosMet on seven software systems, encompassing 123 use cases, and compared the generated results with the ground truth created by two certified professionals. Then, seven professional measurers evaluated the analysis achieved by CosMet and the extent to which the approach reduces the measurement time. The first study's results revealed that CosMet is highly effective in analyzing and measuring use cases. The second study highlighted that CosMet offers a transparent and interpretable analysis, allowing practitioners to understand how the measurement is derived and make necessary adjustments. Additionally, it reduces the manual measurement time by 60-80%."

While existing research has proposed multiple detection tools, automatic and appropriate repair of AC vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a challenge. Unlike commonly supported vulnerability types by existing repair tools, such as reentrancy, which are usually fixed by template-based approaches, the main obstacle of repairing AC vulnerabilities lies in identifying the appropriate roles or permissions amid a long list of non-AC-related source code to generate proper patch code, a task that demands human-level intelligence. In this paper, we employ the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model and enhance it with a novel approach called ACFix. The key insight is that we can mine common AC practices for major categories of code functionality and use them to guide LLMs in fixing code with similar functionality. To this end, ACFix involves offline and online phases. In the offline phase, ACFix mines a taxonomy of common Role-based Access Control practices from 344,251 on-chain contracts, categorizing 49 role-permission pairs from the top 1,000 unique samples. In the online phase, ACFix tracks AC-related elements across the contract and uses this context information along with a Chain-of-Thought pipeline to guide LLMs in identifying the most appropriate role-permission pair for the subject contract and subsequently generating a suitable patch. To evaluate ACFix, we built the first benchmark dataset of 118 real-world AC vulnerabilities, and our evaluation revealed that ACFix successfully repaired 94.92% of them, a major improvement compared to the baseline GPT-4 at only 52.54%. We also conducted a human study to understand the value of ACFix’s repairs and their differences from human repairs."

Current approaches, primarily relying on numerical models, face challenges in spatial-temporal resolution and in capturing the dynamic interplay of environmental, social, and behavioral factors affecting heat risks. This has led to difficulties in translating risk assessments into effective mitigation actions. Recognizing these problems, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the burgeoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract rich and contextual insights from news reports. We hence propose an LLM-empowered visual analytics system, Havior, that integrates the precise, data-driven insights of numerical models with nuanced news report information. This hybrid approach enables a more comprehensive assessment of heat risks and better identification, assessment, and mitigation of heat-related threats. The system incorporates novel visualization designs, such as “thermoglyph” and news glyph, enhancing intuitive understanding and analysis of heat risks. The integration of LLM-based techniques also enables advanced information retrieval and semantic knowledge extraction that can be guided by experts’ analytics needs. We conducted an experiment on information extraction, a case study on the 2022 China Heatwave, and an expert survey & interview collaborated with six domain experts, demonstrating the usefulness of our system in providing in-depth and actionable insights for heat risk management."

In this paper, we first conduct a formative study with eight data analysts to understand their general workflow and pain points of insight management during LLM-powered data analysis. Accordingly, we introduce InsightLens, an interactive system to overcome such challenges. Built upon an LLM-agent-based framework that automates insight recording and organization along with the analysis process, InsightLens visualizes the complex conversational contexts from multiple aspects to facilitate insight navigation.

A common solution to this memory challenge is offloading compute and data from the GPU to the CPU. However, this approach is hampered by the limited bandwidth of commodity hardware, which constrains communication between the CPU and GPU, and by slower matrix multiplications on the CPU.

In this paper, we present an offloading framework, LSP-Offload, that enables near-native speed LLM fine-tuning on commodity hardware through learned sparse projectors. Our data-driven approach involves learning efficient sparse compressors that minimize communication with minimal precision loss. Additionally, we introduce a novel layer-wise communication schedule to maximize parallelism between communication and computation. As a result, our framework can fine-tune a 1.3 billion parameter model on a 4GB laptop GPU and a 6.7 billion parameter model on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24GB memory. Compared to state-of-the-art offloading frameworks, our approach reduces end-to-end fine-tuning time by 33.1%-62.5% when converging to the same accuracy."

To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed, but they often underperform compared to full fine-tuning and struggle with memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce Gradient Weight-Normalized Low-Rank Projection (GradNormLoRP), a novel approach that enhances both parameter and memory efficiency while maintaining comparable performance to full fine-tuning. GradNormLoRP normalizes the weight matrix to improve gradient conditioning, facilitating better convergence during optimization. Additionally, it applies low-rank approximations to the weight and gradient matrices, significantly reducing memory usage during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 8-bit GradNormLoRP reduces optimizer memory usage by up to 89.5\% and enables the pre-training of large LLMs, such as LLaMA 7B, on consumer-level GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 4090, without additional inference costs. Moreover, GradNormLoRP outperforms existing low-rank methods in fine-tuning tasks. For instance, when fine-tuning the RoBERTa model on all GLUE tasks with a rank of 8, GradNormLoRP achieves an average score of 80.65, surpassing LoRA's score of 79.23. These results underscore GradNormLoRP as a promising alternative for efficient LLM pre-training and fine-tuning."

First, existing LLM frameworks incur substantial computational overhead in recomputing attention keys and values (KVs) for understanding context across multiple turns of user queries. Second, as the prompt length of user queries is amplified due to multi-turns, a first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling policy often causes head-of-line blocking issues, leading to underutilization of GPU resources. To address these limitations, we present FlashGen to rapidly complete multi-turn queries by efficiently utilizing the compute and memory resources of GPUs as well as the host hardware (e.g., DRAM and SSD). We introduce a multi-level KV cache comprised of GPU, CPU, and SSD, to efficiently retain attention KVs from prior turns. Our approach employs low-cost cache restoration techniques to avoid the recomputation burden. Further, we propose a request reordering technique to effectively utilize GPU memory. This scheduling technique carefully adjusts the request order without compromising fairness. Our proposed techniques outperform the vLLM framework in terms of both latency and throughput. For OPT 30B and Llama-2 70B models with the ShareGPT dataset, we achieve 1.63x and 2.85x better throughput, respectively while in a similar latency boundary."

It enables on-demand allocation of GPU memory to mitigate KV cache fragmentation - a phenomenon that crippled the batch size (and consequently throughput) in prior systems. However, in trying to allocate physical memory at runtime, PagedAttention ends up changing the virtual memory layout of the KV cache from contiguous to non-contiguous. Such a design leads to non-trivial programming and performance overheads. We present vAttention - an approach that mitigates fragmentation in physical memory while retaining the virtual memory contiguity of the KV cache. We achieve this by decoupling the allocation of virtual and physical memory using CUDA virtual memory management APIs. We also introduce various LLM-specific optimizations to address the limitations of CUDA virtual memory support. Overall, vAttention is a simpler, portable, and performant alternative to PagedAttention: it supports various attention kernels out-of-the-box and improves LLM serving throughput by up to 1.23× compared to the use of PagedAttention-based kernels of FlashAttention-2 and FlashInfer."

As the dependency on robotics grows in warehouses, there is the need for more reliable data and adaptable systems. The traditional system is not flexible enough to support dynamically evolving warehouse infrastructure that leads to inefficiencies and operational challenges. To address these issues, an efficient and trustworthy automation system is highly needed. This paper proposes a Modern Warehouse Management System (MWMS) framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs). The system uses an advanced framework to make it possible for robots to scan inventory on their own, sort packages in real time, plan their paths, assist people in pickup and place items, and to work together on tasks. A mock-up warehouse environment is developed to test and demonstrate the system’s capabilities in robotics assistance in a dynamic environment. The framework is evaluated using three LLMs, demonstrating its ability to interact with real-time data and enhance operational efficiency, accuracy, and trustworthiness."

To do so, LLM-based agents need to reason before responding. For complex tasks like personalized coaching, this reasoning can be informed by adding relevant information at key moments, shifting it in the desired direction. However, the pursuit of objectives beyond interaction quality may compromise this very quality. Moreover, as the depth and informativeness of reasoning increase, so do the number of tokens required, leading to higher latency and cost. This study investigates how an LLM-based coaching agent can adjust its reasoning depth using a discrepancy mechanism that signals how much reasoning effort to allocate based on how well the objective is being met. Our discrepancy-based mechanism constrains reasoning to better align with alternative objectives, reducing cost roughly tenfold while minimally impacting interaction quality."

Historically, problems in GUI development include a fragmented, poorly integrated tool landscape and high synchronization efforts between stakeholders. Recent approaches suggest using large language models (LLMs) to recognize requirements fulfillment in GUIs and automatically propose new GUI components. Based on ten interviews with practitioners, this paper proposes an LLM-based assistant as a Figma plug-in that bridges the gap between user stories and GUI prototyping. We evaluated the prototype with 40 users and 40 crowd-workers, showing that the effectiveness of GUI creation is improved by using LLMs to detect requirements’ completion and generate new GUI components. We derive design rationales to support cross-functional integration in software development, ensuring that our plug-in integrates well into established processes."

They recorded their experiences in autoethnographic diaries and analyzed them during weekly discussions, focusing on the relevance, clarity, and impact of chatbot-generated interventions. Results showed that even though most events triggered by the wearable were meaningful, only one in five warranted an intervention. It also showed that interventions tailored with brief event descriptions were more effective than generic ones.

Results show that LLMs can serve as tools for curriculum design and aids for student learning. For instructors, LLMs streamline the redesign of assignments while maintaining quality. For learners, they provide structured guidance and promote metacognitive development. We position LLMs as reusable educational components that can improve learning outcomes for students and streamline material design for instructors, while preparing both for professional environments where Artificial Intelligence (AI) collaboration is increasingly expected."

StuLAC employs hierarchical matching for fine-grained classification and dynamically updates feedback templates through context-aware cache refinement. Empirical results on 80,000 student feedback entries demonstrate that StuLAC-generated summaries improve overall quality by 10.5% compared to manually generated reports, while also achieving faster processing times. Additionally, StuLAC attains an 86.4% accuracy and an 86.24% F1-score in sentiment detection.

An open-domain LLM often lacks coherent contextual guidance and domain expertise for specific projects, making it challenging to produce complete code that fully meets user requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel planning-guided code generation method, DLCodeGen, tailored for generating deep learning projects. DLCodeGen predicts a structured solution plan, offering global guidance for LLMs to generate the project. The generated plan is then leveraged to retrieve semantically analogous code samples and subsequently abstract a code template. To effectively integrate these multiple retrieval-augmented techniques, a comparative learning mechanism is designed to generate the final code. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a dataset we build for deep learning code generation. Experimental results demonstrate that DLCodeGen outperforms other baselines, achieving improvements of 9.7% in CodeBLEU and 3.6% in human evaluation metrics."

This expansion transforms individual tasks and facilitates complex collaborations where humans and machines work to- gether in unprecedented ways. Through machine learning and, more specifically, large language models (LLMs), AI now plays a crucial role in enhancing productivity. Recent technological advancements have significantly boosted the text generation capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to simulate personas that can represent groups or specific well-known individuals. By simulating expert perspectives, LLMs provide insights to guide human decision-making across various collaborative frameworks in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). Personas, as simulated identities, have proven helpful in group brainstorming sessions, consensus-building exercises, and virtual advisory boards, which help represent diverse viewpoints and facilitate group decisions. Among these CSCW methods, the Delphi method is a well-established approach for reaching consensus among experts through iterative feedback and structured discussions. This work introduces a framework to manage and evaluate LLM-generated personas simulating expert input in Delphi studies. Our contributions include a framework designed for evaluating LLM personas in Delphi studies using a text similarity validation technique comparing real and simulated expert opinions and an evaluation of a Delphi about Brazilian higher education, assessing the LLMs' reliability in real-world scenarios. Findings show LLMs can effectively replicate expert perspectives, enhancing AI integration in specialized decision-making."

However, integrating reflective learning into the syllabus presents challenges, such as the difficulty of grading and the manual effort required to provide in-dividualised feedback. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate formative feedback on student reflections. Our study is conducted in the CS4350 Game Development Project course, where students work in teams to develop a game through multiple milestone assessments over the semester. As part of the reflective learning process, students write reflections at the end of each milestone to prepare for the next. Students are given the option to use our automated feedback tool to improve their submissions. These reflections are graded by Teaching Assistants (TAs). We analyse the impact of the tool by comparing students’ initial reflection drafts with their final submissions and surveying them on their experience with automated feedback. In addition, we assess students’ perceptions of the usefulness of reflective writing in the game development process. Our findings indicate that students who revised their reflections after using the tool showed an improvement in their overall reflection scores, suggesting that automated feedback improves reflection quality. Furthermore, most of the students reported that reflective writing improved their learning experience, citing benefits such as increased self-awareness, better project and time management, and enhanced technical skills."

Additionally, we introduce a cross-channel attention computation scheme that is compatible with the current architecture to support distributed attention operations on BlockPIM. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 62% average throughput increase compared to existing state-of-the-art PIM solutions, enabling efficient and scalable deployment of large language models on PIM architectures."

Quantization is one of the most effective ways to reduce memory consumption of LLMs. However, advanced single-precision quantization methods experience significant accuracy degradation when quantizing to ultra-low bits. Existing mixed-precision quantization methods are quantized by groups with coarse granularity. Employing high precision for group data leads to substantial memory overhead, whereas low precision severely impacts model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose FineQ, software-hardware co-design for low-bit fine-grained mixed-precision quantization of LLMs. First, FineQ partitions the weights into finer-grained clusters and considers the distribution of outliers within these clusters, thus achieving a balance between model accuracy and memory overhead. Then, we propose an outlier protection mechanism within clusters that uses 3 bits to represent outliers and introduce an encoding scheme for index and data concatenation to enable aligned memory access. Finally, we introduce an accelerator utilizing temporal coding that effectively supports the quantization algorithm while simplifying the multipliers in the systolic array. FineQ achieves higher model accuracy compared to the SOTA mixed-precision quantization algorithm at a close average bit-width. Meanwhile, the accelerator achieves up to 1.79x energy efficiency and reduces the area of the systolic array by 61.2%."

In particular, we employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based LLM to extract performance-related information from processor specifications and source code. Additionally, we leverage the predictive capabilities of ML models to create Predictive Models (PMs) for RISC-V processors. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach, we present results on the performance estimation of open-source benchmarks using the generated PMs, with open-source RISC-V-based Register Transfer Level (RTL) implementations as reference models. Our results demonstrate that our proposed LLM-assisted methodology provides highly accurate predictions, with Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPEs) of only 2.50% for SweRV core and 11.90% for RSD core, respectively. In comparison with the state-of-the-art methodology, our approach achieves significant improvements, reducing the MAPE by 61.54% for SweRV and 36.02% for RSD."

Although distributed inference across multiple GPUs is a solution in enterprise settings, it remains inaccessible for most non-commercial users. Thus, there is a growing demand to run LLMs on a single GPU when the model does not fit entirely in GPU memory. A common approach is to offload parts of the model from the GPU to the CPU during inference. However, repeatedly transferring parameters between these devices incurs significant overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a new buffer management policy, LIRS-M, which maximizes buffer hits and minimizes data transfer. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a 2.0× speedup compared to StoA offloading techniques while delivering robust buffer-hit performance."

In this proof-of-concept study, we explore the use of semantic data management to support LLM-driven automation of end-to-end ML pipelines in a real-world Chemistry 4.0 setting. A semantic model is used to capture domain knowledge and metadata in a machine-readable form, guiding LLMs through natural language prompts to generate complete data wrangling and ML modeling code. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to autonomously produce functionally correct Python code for preprocessing and Gaussian Process modeling. Our results show that, when guided by structured semantic context, larger LLMs can reliably generate accurate pipelines, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention. These findings provide an encouraging starting point for further exploration toward leveraging the semantic model to improve the robustness of code generation by systematically integrating relevant information into the generation process, rather than relying solely on the raw intelligence of the LLM."

Traditionally, system builders have relied on standardized interfaces (e.g., POSIX for operating systems) to obtain off-the-shelf components or on n-version programming for custom functionality. Unfortunately, standardized alternatives are rare, and the independent development of multiple versions of the same software is costly and justified only on the most critical applications. In this paper, we show that a limited and focused use of LLMs for translation opens up the possibility of leveraging the existing diversity in functionally equivalent but non-standardized components. Specifically, we show that LLMs can produce functionally correct database query translations with minimal guidance and adapt to diverse data models and query contexts, enabling the use of radically different database models, both SQL and NoSQL, together in a Byzantine fault-tolerant replicated system. We outline an approach to achieve this in practice and discuss future research directions."

From transport systems and autonomous systems to healthcare and financial contracts. So, trustworthiness has become critical. Software trustworthiness refers to the degree to which a software system can be trusted, in the aspects of reliability and security. It means the ability to behave as expected even when facing faults, attacks, or unexpected conditions. Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools can be used to identify security issues, such as software vulnerabilities. Though, SCA tools have a great number of False Positives (FPs) and False Negatives (FNs). Consequently, developers do not use them or spend a lot of time analyzing the alerts reported by such tools without knowing that all vulnerabilities are identified. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used in software engineering tasks, such as code generation, code review, code documentation, and even bug detection. These capabilities have attracted the interest of researchers to their potential for automating Software Trustworthiness Assessment (STA). As the performance of LLMs in STA is not satiable yet, there is an emerging need to obtain the best results out of their great potential. Although there are many works about the use of LLMs for the Software Vulnerability Detection (SVD), to the best of our knowledge, no other works have evaluated their ability to perform STA. This Ph.D. has 4 goals: 1. To evaluate the ability of LLMs to do the STA, 2. To develop a Software Characterization Mechanism based on LLMs, 3. To develop the Software Compliance and Risk Assessment Process supported by LLMs, and 4. To create an LLM-based tool for STA."

This aligns with the wisdom of crowds concept, where diverse agents collectively generate effective solutions, making them well-suited for educational settings. Senior design projects, pivotal in engineering education, integrate theoretical knowledge with practical application, fostering critical thinking, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving skills. These projects often involve multidisciplinary considerations and conflicting objectives, such as optimizing technical performance while addressing ethical, social, and environmental concerns. In this paper, we explore a framework where distinct LLM agents embody expert perspectives, including problem formulation, system complexity, societal and ethical considerations, and project management. These agents engage in rich, collaborative dialogues, leveraging multi-agent system principles like coordination, cooperation, and negotiation. Prompt engineering is employed to create diverse personas, simulating human engineering teams and incorporating swarm AI principles to balance contributions efficiently. To evaluate the framework, we analyzed six senior capstone project proposals from engineering and computer science, comparing Multi-Agent and single-agent LLMs using metrics developed with engineering faculty and widely used NLP-based measures. These metrics assess technical quality, ethical considerations, social impact, and feasibility, aligning with the educational objectives of engineering design. Our findings suggest that Multi-Agent LLMs can provide a richer, more inclusive problem-solving environment compared to single-agent systems with 89% alignment with engineering-faculty scores, offering a promising tool for enhancing the educational experience of engineering and computer science students by simulating the complexity and collaboration of real-world engineering and computer science practice. By supporting senior design projects, this tool not only aids in achieving academic excellence but also prepares students for the multifaceted challenges they will face in their professional engineering careers.

This paper delves into the challenges of sustainable growth of cloud LLM inference, emphasizing extended amortization of CPU embodied over an increased lifespan. Given the reliability risks of silicon aging, we propose an aging-aware CPU core management technique to delay CPU aging effects, allowing the cluster operator to safely increase CPU life. Our technique exploits CPU underutilization patterns that we uncover in cloud LLM inference by halting aging in unused cores and even-outing aging in active cores via selective deep idling and aging-aware inference task allocation. Through extensive simulations using real-world Azure inference traces and an extended LLM cluster simulator from Microsoft, we show superior performance of our technique over existing methods with an estimated 37.67% reduction in yearly embodied carbon emissions through p99 performance of managing CPU aging effects, a 77% reduction in CPU underutilization, and less than 10% impact to the inference service quality."

Traditional crossover techniques typically combine parent variants by selecting modifications uniformly or even randomly, without consideration of contextual relevance, often resulting in inefficient searches and suboptimal solutions due to incompatible or redundant modifications. In contrast, our LLM-assisted crossover leverages context to select and combine edits from parent solutions that are more likely to work well together, with the goal of producing higher quality variants, accelerating optimization. We implemented this approach within MAGPIE, a unified genetic improvement framework. We evaluated against five traditional crossover methods across seven benchmarks, measuring performance on four key metrics: average ranking, best variant execution time, efficiency in reaching performance milestones, and viable variant count. Results show that LLM-assisted crossover achieved an average ranking of 2.27 (on a scale where 1 is best and 6 is worst), making it the top-performing method across benchmarks based on the quality of the optimal variants produced. The LLM-based approach also improved the fitness (execution time) by an average of 8.5 % over the best variant produced by the traditional methods. In terms of efficiency, the LLM-assisted crossover required on average 25.6 % fewer variants to reach $25 \%, 50 \%, 75 \%$, and 100 % of the final performance improvement compared to the traditional methods. Additionally, the LLM-assisted crossover produced 4.8 % more viable variants across scenarios, including both source code modification and parameter tuning cases. These findings suggest that LLMs can significantly enhance genetic improvement by guiding the crossover process toward more effective and viable solutions, providing motivation for further research in LLM-assisted search algorithms."

The complexity levels of design may exacerbate the number of inaccuracies included in an LLM's response. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the features that make prompts generate effective and error-free responses as users. To reduce the error rate of the responses, we test prompt specificity in text and schematic descriptions. As various degrees of specificity, we compare highly intuitive to highly specific prompting. The responses are expressed as network schematics and router configuration commands that are evaluated with our proposed scoring policy. Our tests include networks with three levels of complexity and multiple levels of specificity in text and graphic prompts. The results show the trade-offs on the text and graphic modes and the degrees of specificity."

While generative AI can potentially automate the optimization of network configuration, there is a lack of methods for AI-driven policy automation and enforcement, particularly in translating high-level network intent into suitable service function chains using P4 switch configurations without misconfigurations. In this paper, we present a novel framework, viz., NetPrompt, that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated and intent-driven policy generation in SDN in the context of a video streaming application. By integrating prompt engineering and structured model refinement, pre-trained NetPrompt adaptively selects the appropriate LLM configuration to generate suitable P4 scripts that align with user requirements, such as dynamic QoS adaptation. We validate NetPrompt in network emulators and advanced compute/network testbed environments, including Mininet, Chameleon Cloud, and FABRIC, to construct practical network topologies for evaluation against key performance metrics such as latency reduction, throughput improvement, and error rate minimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that NetPrompt reduces misconfigurations significantly, showcasing its potential in dynamic policy management of programmable networks."

However, managing an activation scratchpad in NPUs becomes challenge, as the size of LLMs and their context sequence lengths continue to grow. Suboptimal activation memory management may cause low on-chip memory usage and excessive off-chip memory accesses due to large activation data, leading to significant performance degradation during LLM inference on NPUs. This challenge necessitates careful methods to maximize on-chip memory utilization. To address the problem, this work proposes an effective activation scratchpad management in NPUs for LLMs via inter-and intra-decoder allocation. Specifically, inter-decoder optimization facilitates the sharing of on-chip memory across stacked decoders, and intra-decoder one interleaves on-chip memory usage among operations in a decoder. We evaluate our approach with OPT models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves 56–79 × reduction in memory usage to naïve on-chip memory management methods."

The LLM interprets user requests expressed in natural language to generate precise network configurations, which the DRL agent uses to optimize resource utilization while meeting Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Simulations demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces latency, enhances bandwidth utilization, minimizes QoS violations, and increases Virtual Network Request (VNR) acceptance rates compared to static allocation strategies.

One of their most important features is long-context capability, which enables them to generate extended text with high semantic coherence, retrieving relevant information, and handling tasks with substantial amounts of text efficiently. The key to improving long-context performance lies in effective data organization and management strategies that integrate data from multiple domains and optimize the context window during training. Through extensive experimental analysis, we identified three key challenges in designing effective data management strategies that enable the model to achieve long-context capability without sacrificing performance in other tasks: (1) a shortage of long documents across multiple domains, (2) effective construction of context windows, and (3) efficient organization of large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce DataSculpt, a novel data management framework designed for long-context training. We first formulate the organization of training data as a multi-objective optimization problem, focusing on attributes including the relevance among documents within the same training sequence, the quantity of concatenated instances, individual document integrity, and computational cost. Specifically, our approach utilizes a coarse-to-fine method to optimize training data organization effectively. We begin by clustering the data based on semantic similarity (coarse), followed by a multi-objective greedy search within each cluster to score and concatenate documents into various context windows (fine). We have deployed DataSculpt as the data management backend for long-context training in Baichuan Inc. Extensive experiments with diverse downstream tasks show that DataSculpt enhances the model's long-context performance by an average of 15.73%, while maintaining the general capabilities with a 4.63% improvement."

The peer review process of the submitted papers is a crucial step in determining the conference agenda, quality, and success. However, this is not an easy task; large conferences often assign hundreds of papers to hundreds of reviewers, making it impossible for a single person to complete the task due to hard time constraints. We propose a Conference Management System that embodies a Large Language Model (LLM) in its core. The LLM is utilized as a Recommendation System which applies Content-based Filtering and automates the task of reviewers-to-papers assignment for a conference. The LLM we select to use is the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), in two specific variants, BERT-tiny and BERT-large."

In this paper, we describe our emerging results for a preliminary functional reference architecture as a conceptual framework to address these challenges and guide the design, evaluation, and evolution of large language model-integrated systems. We identify key architectural concerns for these systems, informed by current research and practice. We then evaluate how the architecture addresses these concerns and validate its applicability using three open-source large language model-integrated systems in computer vision, text processing, and coding."

This study evaluates the performance of LLMs in generating software architecture blueprints, specifically UML component diagrams, from informal natural-language specifications. We develop a formal characterization of component diagrams to derive quantitative metrics for analyzing LLM-generated diagrams, comparing them against expert-drawn ground truths associated with the specifications. Our findings indicate that while LLM-based approaches show promise in addressing the flaws of rule-based methods, they currently lack the accuracy needed for deployment in real-world scenarios."

However, unquestioned reliance on their outputs and recommendations can be problematic as LLMs can reinforce societal biases and stereotypes. This study investigates how LLMs, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot, can reinforce gender and racial stereotypes within the software engineering (SE) profession through both textual and graphical outputs. We used each LLM to generate 300 profiles, consisting of 100 gender-based and 50 gender-neutral profiles, for a recruitment scenario in SE roles. Recommendations were generated for each profile and evaluated against the job requirements for four distinct SE positions. Each LLM was asked to select the top 5 candidates and subsequently the best candidate for each role. Each LLM was also asked to generate images for the top 5 candidates, providing a dataset for analysing potential biases in both text-based selections and visual representations. Our analysis reveals that both models preferred male and Caucasian profiles, particularly for senior roles, and favoured images featuring traits such as lighter skin tones, slimmer body types, and younger appearances. These findings highlight underlying societal biases influence the outputs of LLMs, contributing to narrow, exclusionary stereotypes that can further limit diversity and perpetuate inequities in the SE field. As LLMs are increasingly adopted within SE research and professional practices, awareness of these biases is crucial to prevent the reinforcement of discriminatory norms and to ensure that AI tools are leveraged to promote an inclusive and equitable engineering culture rather than hinder it."

In this work, we present PerfAware, a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently identify performance-sensitive configurations with minimal overhead. PerfAware employs LLM agents to simulate interactions between developers and performance engineers using advanced prompting techniques such as prompt chaining and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our evaluation of seven open-source Java systems demon-strates that PerfAware achieves an average accuracy of 70.55% in classifying performance-sensitive configurations, outperforming both our LLM baseline (58.47%) and the previous state-of-the-art method (60.87%). Notably, our prompt chaining technique improves precision significantly while maintaining similar recall levels. In summary, PerfAware significantly reduces manual effort in classifying performance-sensitive configurations and offers valuable insights for future LLM-based code analysis research."

In practical industrial scenarios, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and interde-pendencies across various documents and system specifications pose significant challenges. This paper presents a system designed for the automated testing of in-vehicle APIs. By clearly defining and segmenting the testing process, we enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to focus on specific tasks, ensuring a stable and controlled testing workflow. Experiments conducted on over 100 APIs demonstrate that our system effectively automates vehicle API testing. The results also confirm that LLMs can efficiently handle mundane tasks requiring human judgment, making them suitable for complete automation in similar industrial contexts."

This framework facilitates the evaluation and iterative improvement of Transference Models– key software components that utilize LLMs to transform inputs into outputs for downstream tasks. To illustrate its utility, we apply the framework to the autoformalization problem, where natural language documentation is transformed into formal program specifications. Our case illustrates how distribution-aware analysis enables the identification of weaknesses and guides focused alignment improvements, resulting in more reliable and interpretable outputs. This principled approach offers a foundation for addressing critical challenges in the development of robust LLM-enabled systems."

Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on high-quality code from platforms like GitHub and other open-source sources, have shown promise in generating optimized code for simple snippets. However, current LLM-based solutions often fall short when tackling project-level programs due to the complexity of call graphs and the intricate interactions among functions. In this paper, we emulate the process a human expert might follow when optimizing project-level programs and introduce a three-phase framework POLO (PrOject-Level Optimizer) to address this limitation. 

First, we profile the program to identify performance bottlenecks using an iterative weighting algorithm. 

Next, we conduct structural analysis by scanning the project and generating a graph that represents the program's structure. 

Finally, two LLM agents collaborate in iterative cycles to rewrite and optimize the code at these hotspots, gradually improving performance. 

We conduct experiments on open-source and proprietary projects. The results demonstrate that POLO accurately identifies performance bottlenecks and successfully applies optimizations. Under the O3 compilation flag, the optimized programs achieved speedups ranging from 1.34x to 21.5x."

Such low-bit LLMs necessitate the mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM), an important yet underexplored operation involving the multiplication of lower-precision weights with higher-precision activations. Off-the-shelf hardware does not support this operation natively, leading to indirect, thus inefficient, dequantization-based implementations. In this paper, we study the lookup table (LUT)-based approach for mpGEMM and find that a conventional LUT implementation fails to achieve the promised gains. To unlock the full potential of LUT-based mpGEMM, we propose LUT Tensor Core, a software-hardware co-design for low-bit LLM inference. LUT Tensor Core differentiates itself from conventional LUT designs through: 1) software-based optimizations to minimize table precompute overhead and weight reinterpretation to reduce table storage; 2) a LUT-based Tensor Core hardware design with an elongated tiling shape to maximize table reuse and a bit-serial design to support diverse precision combinations in mpGEMM; 3) a new instruction set and compilation optimizations for LUT-based mpGEMM. LUT Tensor Core significantly outperforms existing pure software LUT implementations and achieves a 1.44 × improvement in compute density and energy efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art LUT-based accelerators."

The LLM2FedLLM Simulator addresses SE code tasks, such as code summarization, code review, and code translation, within a federated learning framework by first partitioning the selected code dataset into heterogeneous subsets for multiple clients. It then fine-tunes the chosen LLM and evaluates its performance against vanilla, centralized, and individual client models using various metrics. The tool supports several federated aggregation methods and PEFT for supervised learning, with the flexibility to easily integrate additional techniques. The evaluation of our tool on Python code summarization showed that FedLLM performs comparably to centralized models and outperforms individual clients, particularly in low-data scenarios.

Especially in software engineering, LLMs have demonstrated qualitatively better capabilities in code summarization, code generation, and debugging. Despite various research on LLMs for software engineering tasks in practice, limited research captures the benefits of LLMs for pedagogical advancements and their impact on the student learning process. To this extent, we analyze 126 undergraduate students’ interaction with an AI assistant during a 13-week semester to understand the benefits of AI for software engineering learning. We analyze the conversations, code generated, code utilized, and the human intervention levels to integrate the code into the code base.Our findings suggest that students prefer ChatGPT over CoPilot. Our analysis also finds that ChatGPT generates responses with lower computational complexity compared to CoPilot. Furthermore, conversational-based interaction helps improve the quality of the code generated compared to auto-generated code. Early adoption of LLMs in software engineering is crucial to remain competitive in the rapidly developing landscape. Hence, the next generation of software engineers must acquire the necessary skills to interact with AI to improve productivity."

Through a series of experiments, we evaluate the performance of various LLMs in triaging security weaknesses identified by Semgrep. We also study how LLMs perform across different types of vulnerabilities and assess the impact of various prompt engineering strategies. Our results reveal that while some LLM models reduce the accuracy of baseline results with static analysis, they show a consistent improvement with each new model released. In particular, o1-mini significantly outperformed others in our experiments in terms of their accuracy and false positive reduction. Although LLMs might not be ready for prime time in vulnerability detection yet, this study highlights their growing potential to complement existing tools and paves the way for future research to further optimize LLM-based vulnerability detection systems."

However, human-subject studies in our field are challenging, due to the cost and difficulty of finding and employing suitable subjects, ideally, professional programmers with varying degrees of experience. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have recently started to demonstrate human-level performance in several areas. This paper explores the possibility of substituting costly human subjects with much cheaper LLM queries in evaluations of code and coderelated artifacts. We study this idea by applying six state-of-theart LLMs to ten annotation tasks from five datasets created by prior work, such as judging the accuracy of a natural language summary of a method or deciding whether a code change fixes a static analysis warning. Our results show that replacing some human annotation effort with LLMs can produce inter-rater agreements equal or close to human-rater agreement. To help decide when and how to use LLMs in human-subject studies, we propose model-model agreement as a predictor of whether a given task is suitable for LLMs at all, and model confidence as a means to select specific samples where LLMs can safely replace human annotators. Overall, our work is the first step toward mixed human-LLM evaluations in software engineering."

Therefore, there is a need for a tool that translates raw malware data into human-readable descriptions. Developing such a tool accelerates incident response, reduces malware analysts’ cognitive load, and enables individuals having limited technical expertise to understand malicious software behaviour. With this objective, we present MaLAware, which automatically summarizes the full spectrum of malicious activity of malware executables. MaLAware processes Cuckoo Sandbox-generated reports using large language models (LLMs) to correlate malignant activities and generate concise summaries explaining malware behaviour. We evaluate the tool’s performance on five opensource LLMs. The evaluation uses the human-written malware behaviour description dataset as ground truth. The model’s performance is measured using 11 extensive performance metrics, which boosts the confidence of MaLAware’s effectiveness. The current version of the tool, i.e., MaLAware, supports Qwen2.5-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Falcon-7B, along with the quantization feature for resource-constrained environments. MaLAware lays a foundation for future research in malware behavior explanation, and its extensive evaluation demonstrates LLMs’ ability to narrate malware behavior in an actionable and comprehensive manner."

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), with their proven capabilities in code understanding and generation, presents an opportunity to address this limitation. This study introduces LLMSecConfig, an innovative framework that bridges this gap by combining SATs with LLMs. Our approach leverages advanced prompting techniques and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automatically repair security misconfigurations while preserving operational functionality. Evaluation of 1,000 real-world Kubernetes configurations achieved a 94% success rate while maintaining a low rate of introducing new misconfigurations.Our work makes a promising step towards automated container security management, reducing the manual effort required for configuration maintenance."

However, primary challenges include: 1) intent processing (translate, decompose and identify the logic to fulfill the intent), and 2) ensuring intent conformance (ongoing adaptation of the logic to ensure the intent is met, considering dynamic conditions). We use a 3-tier Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline to convert intents into Policy Trees, that are then executed using closed control loop automation. In this paper, we focus on assurance that is tasked with continuous monitoring, verification, and validation of the operational state, and corrective actions to ensure conformance with the target objectives. To do so, we use a generic LLM (OpenAI's GPT) with in-context learning and well-established decision-making algorithms (feedback controllers) to determine assurance actions and remediate intent deviation. We show that AI-driven policies can support intent fulfillment and assurance, and we discuss current limitations, benefits, and future directions to address critical challenges in using AI for network management, towards improved generalizability, scalability, and overall trustworthiness."

This has led to speculation that the orchestration of these repository-level tasks could lead to software engineering agents capable of performing almost independently of human intervention. However, of the suite of tasks that would need to be performed by this autonomous software engineering agent, we argue that one important task is missing, which is to fulfil project level dependency by installing other repositories. To investigate the feasibility of this repository level installation task, we introduce a benchmark of of repository installation tasks curated from 40 open source Python projects, which includes a ground truth installation process for each target repository. Further, we propose Installamatic, an agent which aims to perform and verify the installation of a given repository by searching for relevant instructions from documentation in the repository. Empirical experiments reveal that that 55% of the studied repositories can be automatically installed by our agent at least one out of ten times. Through further analysis, we identify the common causes for our agent's inability to install a repository, discuss the challenges faced in the design and implementation of such an agent and consider the implications that such an agent could have for developers."

We use zero-shot prompting for Copilot Chat and Llama 3.1, and few-shot prompting with Llama only. The LLM-generated solutions are assessed for compilation errors, test failures, and new maintainability problems. Llama with few-shot prompting successfully fixed 44.9 % of the methods, while Copilot Chat and Llama zero-shot fixed 32.29 % and 30 %, respectively. However, most solutions introduced errors or new maintainability issues. We also conducted a human study with 45 participants to evaluate the readability of 51 LLM-generated solutions. The human study showed that 68.63 % of participants observed improved readability. Overall, while LLMs show potential for fixing maintainability issues, their introduction of errors highlights their current limitations."

In particular, extracting semantically-precise specifications from systems is useful for re-engineering of systems to functionally-equivalent versions in different programming languages. Large language models (LLMs) are a type of machine learning (ML) technique that has been utilized in various domains, including software engineering and program translation. Yet, abstracting precise Object Constraint Language (OCL) specifications from source code using LLMs has not gained attention in reverse engineering approaches. In this paper, we present a new reverse engineering approach, named LLM4Models, to abstract OCL specifications from Java and Python programs, using LLMs."

In the last few months, more than 10 new methods have been proposed to perform Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) against LLMs. Contrary to traditional MIAs which rely on fixed-but randomized-records or models, these methods are mostly trained and tested on datasets collected post-hoc. Sets of members and non-members, used to evaluate the MIA, are constructed using informed guesses after the release of a model. This lack of randomization raises concerns of a distribution shift between members and non-members. In this work, we first extensively review the literature on MIAs against LLMs and show that, while most work focuses on sequence-level MIAs evaluated in post-hoc setups, a range of target models, motivations and units of interest are considered. We then quantify distribution shifts present in 6 datasets used in the literature, ranging from books to papers using a model-less bag of word classifier and compare the model-less results to the MIA. Our analysis shows that all of these datasets constructed post-hoc suffer from strong distribution shifts. These shifts invalidate the claims of LLMs memorizing strongly in real-world scenarios and, potentially, also the methodological contributions of the recent papers based on these datasets. Yet, all hope might not be lost. In the second part of this work, we introduce important considerations to properly evaluate MIAs against LLMs and discuss, in turn, potential ways forwards: randomized test splits, injections of randomized (unique) sequences, randomized finetuning, and several post-hoc control methods. While each option comes with its advantages and limitations, we believe they collectively provide solid grounds to guide the development of MIA methods and study LLM memorization. We conclude with an overview of recommended approaches to benchmark sequence-level and document-level MIAs against LLMs."

While the capabilities of LLM agents for software engineering and architecture tasks are currently explored, how to architect LLM-based systems appears to be to date an uncharted territory. Software architectures based on a single LLM agent face inherent challenges, such as lack of task customization, lack of memory, and limited access to ground truth. These challenges become especially pressing in real-world contexts that demand persistent context, validated information, and task-specific flexibility. As a potential solution to overcome these challenges, multiple LLM-agents can be adopted for specialized tasks within a single software-intensive system. In this contribution, we open the discourse on architecting LLM-intensive software products by presenting SALLMA, a Software Architecture for LLMbased Multi-Agent systems. SALLMA leverages two core layers, namely (i) the Operational Layer, responsible for request intent management, handling real-time task execution and dynamic orchestration of agents, and (ii) the Knowledge Layer, used to to store and manage metamodels and configurations for workflows and agents. To primarily assess the viability of SALLMA, we develop a proof of concept leveraging as key technologies Docker, Kubernetes, Python, LangChain, Hugging Face, Mistral, LLaMA, and SQL and NoSQL databases. Currently, SALLMA is deployed to provide information on behalf of public administration offices, and is currently utilized in a business simulation scenario."

While numerous standards and guidelines have been established to aid developers in creating accessible content, studies reveal a persistent lack of accessibility in many web and mobile applications. This gap is often attributed to barriers such as lack of awareness, insufficient knowledge, absence of specific requirements, time constraints, and lack of executive support. In this context, we aim to address the lack of awareness and knowledge challenges by proposing a hands-on approach that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to enhance students' accessibility awareness, knowledge, and practical skills. We engaged software engineering students in tasks involving website development and accessibility evaluation using checker tools, and we utilized ChatGPT 3.5 to fix identified accessibility issues. Our findings suggest that practical assignments significantly enhance learning outcomes, as interactions with LLMs allow students to develop a deeper understanding of accessibility concepts. This approach not only reinforces theoretical knowledge but also highlights the real-world impact of their work. The results indicate that combining practical assignments with AI-driven support effectively improves students' proficiency in web accessibility."

This study investigates how LLMs (large language models), with guided instructions, affect undergraduate software engineering students' ability to transform user feedback into user stories. Students, working individually, were asked to analyze user feedback comments, appropriately group related items, and create user stories following the principles of INVEST, a framework for assessing user stories. We found that LLMs help students develop valuable stories with well-defined acceptance criteria. However, students tend to perform better without LLMs when creating user stories with an appropriate scope."

In this study, a case study is conducted to investigate the accuracy of SPAC-B’s answers to common developer questions when resolving issues on two open-source projects regarding relevance, completeness, and correctness. On a Likert scale (1-5), answers from SPAC-B scored a mean of 4.6 in relevance and 4.3 in completeness and correctness. An experiment with ten software developers is performed to further examine SPAC-B’s ability to help newcomers formulate plans for resolving real-life open-source issues. Results show that the participants could make a better implementation plan with the use of SPAC-B and 8/10 participants found the tool to be helpful."

In this paper, we conduct a preliminary empirical study to emphasize the unique significance of different roles. Building on this insight, we propose AgentFM, a role-aware failure management framework for distributed databases powered by LLM-driven multi-agents. AgentFM addresses failure management by considering system roles, data roles, and task roles, with a meta-agent orchestrating these components. Preliminary evaluations using Apache IoTDB demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentFM and open new directions for further research."

Automating this process could reduce analyst workload and improve response to threats. We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for representing and analyzing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), specifically their ability to generate semantic embeddings that capture the nature of vulnerabilities from textual descriptions. Using a dataset of 4,710 CVEs, we generate vector embeddings with multiple LLMs. We then apply both unsupervised clustering and supervised classification to evaluate the quality of the embeddings. Our preliminary results show that some LLMs – in particular Llama 3.2 – map similar vulnerabilities together in the embedding space. Embeddings seen to position related vulnerabilities in nearby regions, with certain clusters showing strong correspondence to specific categories like SQL Injection (CWE-89) and Path Traversal (CWE-22). A simple KNN classifier using only the embeddings achieves around 50% accuracy when categorizing CVEs. This is a remarkable result, considering the very high number of classes in the problem. Our initial findings show potential for the use of LLMs in vulnerability management processes, calling for deeper analysis on how to better learn representations from vulnerability reports."

Recent advances in AI, particularly large language models, have demonstrated potential for automating simpler grading tasks, such as assessing quizzes or basic writing quality. However, these tools often fall short when it comes to complex metrics, like design innovation and the practical application of knowledge, that require an instructor's educational insights into the class situation. To address this challenge, we conducted a formative study with six instructors and developed CoGrader, which introduces a novel grading workflow combining human-LLM collaborative metrics design, benchmarking, and AI-assisted feedback. CoGrader was found effective in improving grading efficiency and consistency while providing reliable peer-comparative feedback to students. We also discuss design insights and ethical considerations for the development of human-AI collaborative grading systems."

Our results show that 56% of students preferred the LLM feedback, and 52% could not reliably distinguish it from human-written feedback. Student ratings suggest that LLM feedback is perceived as helpful, constructive, and relevant, though it often lacks personalized depth and motivational nuance. These findings underline the potential of LLMs to support scalable, personalized education, while pointing to key areas for responsible improvement. Based on these insights, we outline the future roadmap for the course in which LLM-generated feedback supports students in their learning journey but also instructors through monitoring student performance and helping to allocate instructional resources more effectively.

These are: 1) processing intents, i.e., identification of logic and necessary parameters to fulfill an intent, 2) validating an intent to align it with current network status, and 3) satisfying intents via network optimizing applications. This paper addresses these points via a three-fold strategy to introduce intent-based automation for modern 5G architectures. First, intents are processed via a lightweight Large Language Model (LLM). Secondly, once an intent is processed, it is validated against future incoming traffic volume profiles (high or low). Finally, a series of network optimization applications has been developed. With their machine learning-based functionalities, they can improve certain key performance indicators such as throughput, delay, and energy efficiency. In the final stage, using an attention-based hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm, these applications are optimally initiated to satisfy the intent of an operator. Our simulations show that the proposed method can achieve at least a 12% increase in throughput, a 17.1% increase in energy efficiency, and a 26.5% decrease in network delay compared to the baseline algorithms."

However, the process is effort-intensive, prone to errors, and lays various challenges during their conduction. To overcome some of these issues, there is a growing belief that Large Language Models (LLMs) can support systematic literature reviews. While the literature has shown promising results in social sciences, more evidence of its accuracy is needed in technical fields like SE. In this context, studies and replications are essential in verifying the benefits and drawbacks of applying LLMs in systematic literature reviews. This paper discusses the difficulties in conducting and replicating studies that adopt LLMs to support systematic literature in SE.

However, as jailbreak attacks continue to circumvent built-in safety mechanisms, exploiting carefully crafted scenarios or tokens, the safety risks of LLMs have come into focus. While numerous defense strategies-such as prompt detection, modification, and model fine-tuning-have been proposed to counter these attacks, a critical question arises: do these defenses compromise the utility and usability of LLMs for legitimate users? Existing research predominantly focuses on the effectiveness of defense strategies without thoroughly examining their impact on performance, leaving a gap in understanding the trade-offs between LLM safety and performance. Our research addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive study on the utility degradation, safety elevation, and exaggerated-safety escalation of LLMs with jailbreak defense strategies. We propose USEBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate these aspects, along with USEIndex, a comprehensive metric for assessing overall model performance. Through experiments on seven state-of-the-art LLMs, we found that mainstream jailbreak defenses fail to ensure both safety and performance simultaneously. Although model-finetuning performs the best overall, their effectiveness varies across LLMs. Furthermore, vertical comparisons reveal that developers commonly prioritize performance over safety when iterating or fine-tuning their LLMs."

Techniques such as random program generation and differential testing have proved highly effective and have uncovered thousands of bugs in production compilers. The majority of effort has been expended on validating that a compiler produces correct code for a given input, while less attention has been paid to ensuring that the compiler produces performant code. In this work we adapt differential testing to the task of identifying missed optimization opportunities in compilers. We develop a novel testing approach which combines large language models (LLMs) with a series of differential testing strategies and use them to find missing code size optimizations in C / C++ compilers. The advantage of our approach is its simplicity. We offload the complex task of generating random code to an off-the-shelf LLM, and use heuristics and analyses to identify anomalous compiler behavior. Our approach requires fewer than 150 lines of code to implement. This simplicity makes it extensible. By simply changing the target compiler and initial LLM prompt we port the approach from C / C++ to Rust and Swift, finding bugs in both. To date we have reported 24 confirmed bugs in production compilers, and conclude that LLM-assisted testing is a promising avenue for detecting optimization bugs in real world compilers."

While deep learning approaches have been applied to address these challenges, their black-box nature raises concerns about trust and explainability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications due to their ability to understand multi-modal data and generate explainable decisions. However, single LLM faces limitations in complex, comprehensive tasks such as asset investment. These limitations are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency investment, where LLMs have less domain-specific knowledge in their training corpora. To overcome these challenges, we propose an explainable, multi-modal, multi-agent framework for cryptocurrency investment. Our framework uses specialized agents that collaborate within and across teams to handle subtasks such as data analysis, literature integration, and investment decision-making for the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The expert training module fine-tunes agents using multi-modal historical data and professional investment literature, while the multi-agent investment module employs real-time data to make informed cryptocurrency investment decisions. Unique intrateam and interteam collaboration mechanisms enhance prediction accuracy by adjusting final predictions based on confidence levels within agent teams and facilitating information sharing between teams. Empirical evaluation using data from November 2023 to September 2024 demonstrates that our framework outperforms single-agent models and market benchmarks in classification, asset pricing, portfolio, and explainability performance."

To address this gap, we present the first study on testing, specifically unit testing, for ADS source code. Our study focuses on an industrial ADS framework, Autoware. We analyze both human-written test cases and those generated by large language models (LLMs). Our findings reveal that human-written test cases in Autoware exhibit limited test coverage, and significant challenges remain in applying LLM-generated tests for Autoware unit testing. To overcome these challenges, we propose AwTest-LLM, a novel approach to enhance test coverage and improve test case pass rates across Autoware packages."

In this paper, we investigate the opportunities of LLMs for automatic regression test generation for programs that take highly structured, human-readable inputs, such as XML parsers or JavaScript interpreters. Concretely, we explore the following regression test generation scenarios for such programs that have so far been difficult to test automatically in the absence of corresponding input grammars: $\bullet$ Bug finding. Given a code change (e.g., a commit or pull request), our LLM-based approach generates a test case with the objective of revealing any bugs that might be introduced if that change is applied. $\bullet$ Patch testing. Given a patch, our LLM-based approach generates a test case that fails before but passes after the patch. This test can be added to the regression test suite to catch similar bugs in the future. We implement Cleverest, a feedback-directed, zero-shot LLM-based regression test generation technique, and evaluate its effectiveness on 22 commits to three subject programs: Mujs, Libxml2, and Poppler. For programs using more human-readable file formats, like XML or JavaScript, we found Cleverest performed very well. It generated easy-to-understand bug-revealing or bug-reproduction test cases for the majority of commits in just under three minutes -- even when only the code diff or commit message (unless it was too vague) was given. For programs with more compact file formats, like PDF, as expected, it struggled to generate effective test cases. However, the LLM-supplied test cases are not very far from becoming effective (e.g., when used as a seed by a greybox fuzzer or as a starting point by the developer)."

 Unit testing plays a pivotal role in the software development lifecycle, as it ensures code quality. However, writing high-quality unit tests remains a time-consuming task for developers in practice. More recently, the application of large language models (LLMs) in automated unit test generation has demonstrated promising results. Existing approaches primarily focus on interpreted programming languages (e.g., Java), while mature solutions tailored to compiled programming languages like C++ are yet to be explored. The intricate language features of C++, such as pointers, templates, and virtual functions, pose particular challenges for LLMs in generating both executable and high-coverage unit tests. To tackle the aforementioned problems, this paper introduces
 CITYWALK
 , a novel LLM-based framework for C++ unit test generation.
 CITYWALK
 enhances LLMs by providing a comprehensive understanding of the dependency relationships within the project under test via program analysis. Furthermore,
 CITYWALK
 incorporates language-specific knowledge about C++ derived from project documentation and empirical observations, significantly improving the correctness of the LLM-generated unit tests. We implement
 CITYWALK
 by employing the widely popular LLM GPT-4o. The experimental results show that
 CITYWALK
 outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on a collection of ten popular C++ projects. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of
 CITYWALK
 in generating high-quality C++ unit tests.

They tend to prefer that LLMs default to communicating in Mainstream U.S. English in formal settings, with greater interest in AAE production in less formal settings.

However, their lack of reliability and modularity limits their capacity to tackle large problems that require many steps of reasoning. In response, researchers have proposed advanced pipelines that leverage domain-specific knowledge to chain smaller prompts, provide intermediate feedback and improve performance through search. However, the current complexity of writing, tuning, maintaining and improving such pipelines has limited their sophistication. We propose oracular programming, a foundational paradigm for building LLM-enabled applications that lets domain experts express high-level problem-solving strategies as programs with unresolved choice points. These choice points are resolved at runtime by LLMs, which generalize from user-provided examples of correct and incorrect decisions. An oracular program is composed of three orthogonal components: a strategy that consists in a nondeterministic program with choice points that can be reified into a search tree, a policy that specifies how to navigate this tree with the help of LLM oracles, and a set of demonstrations that describe successful and unsuccessful search tree navigation scenarios across diverse problem instances. Each component is expressed in a dedicated programming language and can be independently improved or substituted. We address the key programming language design challenges of modularly composing oracular programs and enforcing consistency between their components as they evolve."

However, their reliance on extensive and often undisclosed pre-training datasets raises significant concerns about data leakage, where the evaluation benchmark data is unintentionally ``seen'' by LLMs during the model's construction phase. The data leakage issue could largely undermine the validity of LLM-based research and evaluations. Despite the increasing use of LLMs in the SE community, there is no comprehensive study that assesses the extent of data leakage in SE benchmarks for LLMs yet. To address this gap, this paper presents the first large-scale analysis of data leakage in 83 SE benchmarks concerning LLMs. Our results show that in general, data leakage in SE benchmarks is minimal, with average leakage ratios of only 4.8\%, 2.8\%, and 0.7\% for Python, Java, and C/C++ benchmarks, respectively. However, some benchmarks exhibit relatively higher leakage ratios, which raises concerns about their bias in evaluation. For instance, QuixBugs and BigCloneBench have leakage ratios of 100.0\% and 55.7\%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that data leakage has a substantial impact on LLM evaluation. We also identify key causes of high data leakage, such as the direct inclusion of benchmark data in pre-training datasets and the use of coding platforms like LeetCode for benchmark construction. To address the data leakage, we introduce \textbf{LessLeak-Bench}, a new benchmark that removes leaked samples from the 83 SE benchmarks, enabling more reliable LLM evaluations in future research. Our study enhances the understanding of data leakage in SE benchmarks and provides valuable insights for future research involving LLMs in SE."

So, when working with a different language, this has led to the widespread practice of pre-translation, i.e., translating the task prompt into English before inference. Selective pre-translation, a more surgical approach, focuses on translating specific prompt components. However, its current use is sporagic and lacks a systematic research foundation. Consequently, the optimal pre-translation strategy for various multilingual settings and tasks remains unclear. In this work, we aim to uncover the optimal setup for pre-translation by systematically assessing its use. Specifically, we view the prompt as a modular entity, composed of four functional parts: instruction, context, examples, and output, either of which could be translated or not. We evaluate pre-translation strategies across 35 languages covering both low and high-resource languages, on various tasks including Question Answering (QA), Natural Language Inference (NLI), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Abstractive Summarization. Our experiments show the impact of factors as similarity to English, translation quality and the size of pre-trained data, on the model performance with pre-translation. We suggest practical guidelines for choosing optimal strategies in various multilingual settings."

This paper proposes a semantic voice activity detection (VAD) module as a dialogue manager (DM) to efficiently manage turn-taking in full-duplex SDS. Implemented as a lightweight (0.5B) LLM fine-tuned on full-duplex conversation data, the semantic VAD predicts four control tokens to regulate turn-switching and turn-keeping, distinguishing between intentional and unintentional barge-ins while detecting query completion for handling user pauses and hesitations. By processing input speech in short intervals, the semantic VAD enables real-time decision-making, while the core dialogue engine (CDE) is only activated for response generation, reducing computational overhead. This design allows independent DM optimization without retraining the CDE, balancing interaction accuracy and inference efficiency for scalable, next-generation full-duplex SDS."

Addressing this gap, we propose PURE, a novel LLM-based recommendation framework that builds and maintains evolving user profiles by systematically extracting and summarizing key information from user reviews. PURE consists of three core components: a Review Extractor for identifying user preferences and key product features, a Profile Updater for refining and updating user profiles, and a Recommender for generating personalized recommendations using the most current profile. To evaluate PURE, we introduce a continuous sequential recommendation task that reflects real-world scenarios by adding reviews over time and updating predictions incrementally. Our experimental results on Amazon datasets demonstrate that PURE outperforms existing LLM-based methods, effectively leveraging long-term user information while managing token limitations."

Ensemble ToT follows three steps: (1) analyzing LLM performance, (2) generating candidate answers, and (3) refining them into a final result. Based on this, our grading system first evaluates the grading tendencies of LLMs, then generates multiple results, and finally integrates them via a simulated debate.

In this study, we introduce the idea of Interoperable LP (ILP), which leverages literate programming principles to enhance the development of both small-scale documents and large-scale projects with LLMs. We investigate how LLMs perform under ILP-style instructions for both document-oriented tasks and entire projects. Recognizing that many researchers rely on well-structured templates to guide LLMs, we propose a concise prompt engineering method to write LP documents so LLMs can better be involved in code generation. We also examine the capacity of various LLMs to generate Scheme and Python code on the RepoBench benchmark, illustrating the advantages of our approach. Our findings indicate that ILP with LLMs can enhance LLM-based code generation in large-scale project development."

While DeepSeek-R1 and other follow-up work primarily focus on applying RL to competitive coding and math problems, this paper introduces SWE-RL, the first approach to scale RL-based LLM reasoning for real-world software engineering. Leveraging a lightweight rule-based reward (e.g., the similarity score between ground-truth and LLM-generated solutions), SWE-RL enables LLMs to autonomously recover a developer's reasoning processes and solutions by learning from extensive open-source software evolution data -- the record of a software's entire lifecycle, including its code snapshots, code changes, and events such as issues and pull requests. Trained on top of Llama 3, our resulting reasoning model, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B, achieves a 41.0% solve rate on SWE-bench Verified -- a human-verified collection of real-world GitHub issues. To our knowledge, this is the best performance reported for medium-sized (<100B) LLMs to date, even comparable to leading proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o. Surprisingly, despite performing RL solely on software evolution data, Llama3-SWE-RL has even emerged with generalized reasoning skills. For example, it shows improved results on five out-of-domain tasks, namely, function coding, library use, code reasoning, mathematics, and general language understanding, whereas a supervised-finetuning baseline even leads to performance degradation on average. Overall, SWE-RL opens up a new direction to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement learning on massive software engineering data."

We propose a new idea for the community to adopt: convert scholarly documents into knowledge preserving, but style agnostic representations we term Knowledge Units using LLMs. These units use structured data capturing entities, attributes and relationships without stylistic content. We provide evidence that Knowledge Units (1) form a legally defensible framework for sharing knowledge from copyrighted research texts, based on legal analyses of German copyright law and U.S. Fair Use doctrine, and (2) preserve most (~95\%) factual knowledge from original text, measured by MCQ performance on facts from the original copyrighted text across four research domains. Freeing scientific knowledge from copyright promises transformative benefits for scientific research and education by allowing language models to reuse important facts from copyrighted text. To support this, we share open-source tools for converting research documents into Knowledge Units.

However, these applications frequently exhibit robustness deficiencies, where slight perturbations in input (prompt+example) may lead to erroneous outputs. Current robustness testing methods face two main limitations: (1) low testing effectiveness, limiting the applicability of LLM-based software in safety-critical scenarios, and (2) insufficient naturalness of test cases, reducing the practical value of testing outcomes. To address these issues, this paper proposes ABFS, a straightforward yet effective automated testing method that, for the first time, treats the input prompts and examples as a unified whole for robustness testing. Specifically, ABFS formulates the testing process as a combinatorial optimization problem, employing Best-First Search to identify successful test cases within the perturbation space and designing a novel Adaptive control strategy to enhance test case naturalness. We evaluate the robustness testing performance of ABFS on three datasets across five threat models. On Llama2-13b, the traditional StressTest achieves only a 13.273% success rate, while ABFS attains a success rate of 98.064%, supporting a more comprehensive robustness assessment before software deployment. Compared to baseline methods, ABFS introduces fewer modifications to the original input and consistently generates test cases with superior naturalness. Furthermore, test cases generated by ABFS exhibit stronger transferability and higher testing efficiency, significantly reducing testing costs."

Traditional automated metrics like BLEU rely on high-quality references and struggle to capture nuanced aspects of software quality, such as readability and usefulness. In response, the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, which employs LLMs for automated evaluation, has emerged. Given that LLMs are typically trained to align with human judgment and possess strong coding abilities and reasoning skills, they hold promise as cost-effective and scalable surrogates for human evaluators. Nevertheless, LLM-as-a-Judge research in the SE community is still in its early stages, with many breakthroughs needed. This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the research community toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLMgenerated software artifacts, while also sharing potential research paths to achieve this goal. We provide a literature review of existing SE studies on LLM-as-a-Judge and envision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates capable of evaluating software artifacts with consistent, multi-faceted assessments by 2030 and beyond. To validate this vision, we analyze the limitations of current studies, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap to guide future developments of LLM-as-a-Judge in software engineering.

As a result, a new software paradigm, promptware, has emerged, using natural language prompts to interact with LLMs and enabling complex tasks without traditional coding. Unlike traditional software, which relies on formal programming languages and deterministic runtime environments, promptware is based on ambiguous, unstructured, and context-dependent natural language and operates on LLMs as runtime environments, which are probabilistic and non-deterministic. These fundamental differences introduce unique challenges in prompt development. In practice, prompt development is largely ad hoc and experimental, relying on a time-consuming trial-and-error process - a challenge we term the 'promptware crisis.' To address this, we propose promptware engineering, a new methodology that adapts established software engineering principles to the process of prompt development. Building on decades of success in traditional software engineering, we envision a systematic framework that includes prompt requirements engineering, design, implementation, testing, debugging, and evolution. Unlike traditional software engineering, our framework is specifically tailored to the unique characteristics of prompt development. This paper outlines a comprehensive roadmap for promptware engineering, identifying key research directions and offering actionable insights to advance LLM-based software development."

Smaller language models (SLMs), typically with<13B parameters, have been improved by using the data generated from very-large LMs through knowledge distillation. However, various practical constraints such as API costs, copyright, legal and ethical policies restrict using large (often opaque) models to train smaller models for commercial use. Limited success has been achieved at improving the ability of an SLM to explore the space of possible rationales and evaluate them by itself through self-deliberation. To address this, we propose COALITION, a trainable framework that facilitates interaction between two variants of the same SLM and trains them to generate and refine rationales optimized for the end-task. The variants exhibit different behaviors to produce a set of diverse candidate rationales during the generation and refinement steps. The model is then trained via Selective Rationale Optimization (SRO) to prefer generating rationale candidates that maximize the likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. During inference, COALITION employs a controller to select the suitable variant for generating and refining the rationales. On five different datasets covering mathematical problems, commonsense reasoning, and natural language inference, COALITION outperforms several baselines by up to 5%. Our ablation studies reveal that cross-communication between the two variants performs better than using the single model to self-refine the rationales. We also demonstrate the applicability of COALITION for LMs of varying scales (4B to 14B parameters) and model families (Mistral, Llama, Qwen, Phi).

Despite their growing adoption, there is a notable lack of formal, qualitative assessments of how LLMs are applied in real-world software development contexts. To fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with sixteen early-adopter professional developers to explore their use of LLMs throughout various stages of the software development life cycle. Our investigation examines four dimensions: people - how LLMs affect individual developers and teams; process - how LLMs alter software engineering workflows; product - LLM impact on software quality and innovation; and society - the broader socioeconomic and ethical implications of LLM adoption. Thematic analysis of our data reveals that while LLMs have not fundamentally revolutionized the development process, they have substantially enhanced routine coding tasks, including code generation, refactoring, and debugging. Developers reported the most effective outcomes when providing LLMs with clear, well-defined problem statements, indicating that LLMs excel with decomposed problems and specific requirements. Furthermore, these early-adopters identified that LLMs offer significant value for personal and professional development, aiding in learning new languages and concepts. Early-adopters, highly skilled in software engineering and how LLMs work, identified early and persisting challenges for software engineering, such as inaccuracies in generated content and the need for careful manual review before integrating LLM outputs into production environments. Our study provides a nuanced understanding of how LLMs are shaping the landscape of software development, with their benefits, limitations, and ongoing implications."

Existing research demonstrates the effectiveness of grammar-based code representations in small-scale models, showing their ability to reduce syntax errors and enhance performance. However, as language models scale to the billion level or beyond, syntax-level errors become rare, making it unclear whether grammar information still provides performance benefits. To explore this, we develop a series of billion-scale GrammarCoder models, incorporating grammar rules in the code generation process. Experiments on HumanEval (+) and MBPP (+) demonstrate a notable improvement in code generation accuracy. Further analysis shows that grammar-based representations enhance LLMs' ability to discern subtle code differences, reducing semantic errors caused by minor variations. These findings suggest that grammar-based code representations remain valuable even in billion-scale models, not only by maintaining syntax correctness but also by improving semantic differentiation."

We present the first comprehensive study of MoA's robustness against deceptive LLM agents that deliberately provide misleading responses. We examine factors like the propagation of deceptive information, model size, and information availability, and uncover critical vulnerabilities. On AlpacaEval 2.0, the popular LLaMA 3.1-70B model achieves a length-controlled Win Rate (LC WR) of 49.2% when coupled with 3-layer MoA (6 LLM agents). However, we demonstrate that introducing only a $\textit{single}$ carefully-instructed deceptive agent into the MoA can reduce performance to 37.9%, effectively nullifying all MoA gains. On QuALITY, a multiple-choice comprehension task, the impact is also severe, with accuracy plummeting by a staggering 48.5%.

In this work, we introduce a generic model proficient in factuality, stylistic, and conversational rewriting tasks. To simulate real-world user rewrite requests, we construct a conversational rewrite dataset, ChatRewrite, that presents ``natural''-sounding instructions, from raw emails using LLMs. Combined with other popular rewrite datasets, including LongFact for the factuality rewrite task and RewriteLM for the stylistic rewrite task, this forms a broad benchmark for training and evaluating generic rewrite models.

SagaLLM bridges this gap by integrating the Saga transactional pattern with persistent memory, automated compensation, and independent validation agents. It leverages LLMs' generative reasoning to automate key tasks traditionally requiring hand-coded coordination logic, including state tracking, dependency analysis, log schema generation, and recovery orchestration. Although SagaLLM relaxes strict ACID guarantees, it ensures workflow-wide consistency and recovery through modular checkpointing and compensable execution. Empirical evaluations across planning domains demonstrate that standalone LLMs frequently violate interdependent constraints or fail to recover from disruptions. In contrast, SagaLLM achieves significant improvements in consistency, validation accuracy, and adaptive coordination under uncertainty—establishing a robust foundation for real-world, scalable LLM-based multi-agent systems."

 The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Software Engineering (SE) continues to grow rapidly across both industry and academia. As these models become integral to critical SE processes, ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness becomes essential. Achieving this requires a balanced approach to trust: excessive trust can introduce security vulnerabilities, while insufficient trust may hinder innovation. However, the conceptual landscape of trust in LLMs for SE(LLM4SE) remains unclear. Key concepts such as trust, distrust, and trustworthiness lack precise definitions, factors that shape trust formation remain underexplored, and metrics for trust in LLMs remain undeveloped. To clarify the current research landscape and identify future directions, we conducted a comprehensive review of

Existing works have shown that RAG can help with software development tasks such as code generation, code update, and test generation. Yet, the effectiveness of adapting LLMs to fast-evolving or less common API libraries using RAG remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step to study this unexplored yet practical setting - when developers code with a less common library, they often refer to its API documentation; likewise, when LLMs are allowed to look up API documentation via RAG, to what extent can LLMs be advanced? To mimic such a setting, we select four less common open-source Python libraries with a total of 1017 eligible APIs. We study the factors that affect the effectiveness of using the documentation of less common API libraries as additional knowledge for retrieval and generation. Our intensive study yields interesting findings: (1) RAG helps improve LLMs' performance by 83%-220%. (2) Example code contributes the most to advance LLMs, instead of the descriptive texts and parameter lists in the API documentation. (3) LLMs could sometimes tolerate mild noises (typos in description or incorrect parameters) by referencing their pre-trained knowledge or document context. Finally, we suggest that developers pay more attention to the quality and diversity of the code examples in the API documentation.

However, vastly different features between C and Rust--e.g., distinct definitions and usages of pointers and references--pose significant challenges beyond mere syntactic translation. Existing automated translation tools, such as C2Rust, may rely too much on syntactic, template-based translation and generate unsafe Rust code that is hard for human developers to read, maintain, or even compile. More semantic-aware translation that produces safer, idiomatic, and runnable Rust code is much needed. This paper introduces a novel dependency-guided and large language model (LLM)-based C-to-Rust translation approach, RustMap, based on three key ideas: (1) Utilize LLM capabilities to produce idiomatic Rust code from given small pieces of C code, (2) Mitigate LLM limitations in handling large codebases by breaking project-scale C programs into smaller units for translation according to their usage dependencies and composing them into a runnable Rust program, and (3) Enhance the correctness of the translated Rust program by using test cases to check input/output equivalence, isolate faulty code when execution states deviate, and iteratively refine the translation using feedback from compilation and test errors. We empirically evaluate RustMap on 126 real-world programs, including 125 from Rosetta Code and a 7000+ line bzip2 implementation using GPT-4o as the LLM. RustMap shows promising results, guiding GPT-4o to produce idiomatic, readable, and functional Rust code with significantly less unsafe code than other tools, and revealing non-trivial translation patterns reusable for future research."

In this paper, we present Jenga, a novel memory allocation framework for heterogeneous embeddings in LLMs. Jenga tackles two key challenges: (1) minimizing memory fragmentation when managing embeddings of different sizes, and (2) enabling flexible caching and eviction policies tailored to the specific token-dependency patterns of various layers. Jenga employs a two-level memory allocator, leveraging the least common multiple (LCM) of embedding sizes to optimize memory usage and providing APIs to express layer-specific caching logic to enhance memory reuse. We implemente Jenga on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference engine, and evaluate it with diverse LLMs, datasets, and GPU configurations.

However, their broad applicability comes at a high-cost computational overhead, particularly in auto-regressive decoding where each step requires a forward pass. In domain-specific settings, general-purpose capabilities are unnecessary and can be exchanged for efficiency. In this work, we take a novel perspective on domain adaptation, reducing latency and computational costs by adapting the vocabulary to focused domains of interest. We introduce AdaptiVocab, an end-to-end approach for vocabulary adaptation, designed to enhance LLM efficiency in low-resource domains. AdaptiVocab can be applied to any tokenizer and architecture, modifying the vocabulary by replacing tokens with domain-specific n-gram-based tokens, thereby reducing the number of tokens required for both input processing and output generation. AdaptiVocab initializes new n-token embeddings using an exponentially weighted combination of existing embeddings and employs a lightweight fine-tuning phase that can be efficiently performed on a single GPU. We evaluate two 7B LLMs across three niche domains, assessing efficiency, generation quality, and end-task performance. Our results show that AdaptiVocab reduces token usage by over 25% without compromising performance"

This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based system for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and generates optimized Python code. Unlike traditional multi-agent or planning-based systems that can be slow, opaque, and costly to maintain, GateLens emphasizes speed, transparency, and reliability. Experimental results show that GateLens outperforms the existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) + Self-Consistency (SC) based system on real-world datasets, particularly in handling complex and ambiguous queries. Ablation studies confirm the essential role of the RA layer. Industrial deployment shows over 80% reduction in analysis time while maintaining high accuracy across test result interpretation, impact assessment, and release candidate evaluation. GateLens operates effectively in zero-shot settings without requiring few-shot examples or agent orchestration.

While LLMs offer benefits such as enhanced learning experiences, automated assessments, and personalized tutoring, their integration also raises concerns about academic integrity, student over-reliance, and ethical considerations. In this study, we conducted a preliminary literature review to identify motivators and demotivators for using LLMs in software engineering education. We applied a thematic mapping process to categorize and structure these factors (motivators and demotivators), offering a comprehensive view of their impact. In total, we identified 25 motivators and 30 demotivators, which are further organized into four high-level themes. This mapping provides a structured framework for understanding the factors that influence the integration of LLMs in software engineering education, both positively and negatively. As part of a larger research project, this study serves as a feasibility assessment, laying the groundwork for future systematic literature review and empirical studies. Ultimately, this project aims to develop a framework to assist Finnish higher education institutions in effectively integrating LLMs into software engineering education while addressing potential risks and challenges."

Despite this, existing benchmarks often fail to capture these dynamics, primarily focusing on static, open-ended evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce LIFESTATE-BENCH, a benchmark designed to assess lifelong learning in LLMs. It features two episodic datasets: Hamlet and a synthetic script collection, rich in narrative structure and character interactions. Our fact checking evaluation probes models' self-awareness, episodic memory retrieval, and relationship tracking, across both parametric and non-parametric approaches. Experiments on models like Llama3.1-8B, GPT-4-turbo, and DeepSeek R1, we demonstrate that nonparametric methods significantly outperform parametric ones in managing stateful learning. However, all models exhibit challenges with catastrophic forgetting as interactions extend, highlighting the need for further advancements in lifelong learning."

Automation in code generation for ADS using Large Language Models (LLM) is one potential approach to address this challenge. Nevertheless, the development of ADS requires rigorous processes to verify, validate, assess, and qualify the code before it can be deployed in the vehicle and used. In this study, we developed and evaluated a prototype for automatic code generation and assessment using a designed pipeline of a LLM-based agent, simulation model, and rule-based feedback generator in an industrial setup.

Research has explored their role within development teams, focusing on specific tasks such as artifact generation, decision-making support, and information retrieval. Despite the growing body of work on LLMs in software engineering, most studies have centered on broad adoption trends, neglecting the nuanced relationship between individual cognitive and behavioral factors and their impact on task-specific adoption. While factors such as perceived effort and performance expectancy have been explored at a general level, their influence on distinct software engineering tasks remains underexamined. This gap hinders the development of tailored LLM-based systems (e.g., Generative AI Agents) that align with engineers' specific needs and limits the ability of team leaders to devise effective strategies for fostering LLM adoption in targeted workflows. This study bridges this gap by surveying N=188 software engineers to test the relationship between individual attributes related to technology adoption and LLM adoption across five key tasks, using structural equation modeling (SEM). The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was applied to characterize individual adoption behaviors. The findings reveal that task-specific adoption is influenced by distinct factors, some of which negatively impact adoption when considered in isolation, underscoring the complexity of LLM integration in software engineering. To support effective adoption, this article provides actionable recommendations, such as seamlessly integrating LLMs into existing development environments and encouraging peer-driven knowledge sharing to enhance information retrieval."

This creates a range of challenges, including selecting an appropriate architecture for a system and assessing different architectural alternatives. Relying on human expertise to accomplish the task of mapping NL requirements to architecture is time-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposes ARLO, an approach that automates this task by leveraging (1) a set of NL requirements for a system, (2) an existing standard that specifies architecturally relevant software quality attributes, and (3) a readily available Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, ARLO determines the subset of NL requirements for a given system that is architecturally relevant and maps that subset to a tailorable matrix of architectural choices. ARLO applies integer linear programming on the architectural-choice matrix to determine the optimal architecture for the current requirements. We demonstrate ARLO's efficacy using a set of real-world examples. We highlight ARLO's ability (1) to trace the selected architectural choices to the requirements and (2) to isolate NL requirements that exert a particular influence on a system's architecture. This allows the identification, comparative assessment, and exploration of alternative architectural choices based on the requirements and constraints expressed therein."

To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce""Outlandish,""a carefully curated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new knowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this dataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can be predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before learning. This relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2, Gemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, we develop two novel techniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a ``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update pruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95\% while preserving the model's ability to learn new information.

Despite their various capabilities and constant use, some interactions can lead to unexpected challenges (e.g. hallucinations or verbose answers) and, in turn, cause emotions that develop into frustration. Frustration can negatively impact engineers' productivity and well-being if they escalate into stress and burnout. In this paper, we assess the impact of LLM interactions on software engineers' emotional responses, specifically strains, and identify common causes of frustration when interacting with LLMs at work. Based on 62 survey responses from software engineers in industry and academia across various companies and universities, we found that a majority of our respondents experience frustrations or other related emotions regardless of the nature of their work. Additionally, our results showed that frustration mainly stemmed from issues with correctness and less critical issues such as adaptability to context or specific format. While such issues may not cause frustration in general, artefacts that do not follow certain preferences, standards, or best practices can make the output unusable without extensive modification, causing frustration over time. In addition to the frustration triggers, our study offers guidelines to improve the software engineers' experience, aiming to minimise long-term consequences on mental health."

This data transformation step introduces uncertainty that can be propagated to the visual representation and influence users' interpretation of the data. To communicate such uncertainties, we present LayerFlow – a visual analytics workspace that displays embeddings in an interlinked projection design and communicates the transformation, representation, and interpretation uncertainty. In particular, to hint at potential data distortions and uncertainties, the workspace includes several visual components, such as convex hulls showing 2D and HD clusters, data point pairwise distances, cluster summaries, and projection quality metrics. We show the usability of the presented workspace through replication and expert case studies that highlight the need to communicate uncertainty through multiple visual components and different data perspectives."

In this paper, we evaluate the cross-lingual context retrieval ability of over 40 LLMs across 12 languages to understand the source of this ability, using cross-lingual machine reading comprehension (xMRC) as a representative scenario. Our results show that several small, post-trained open LLMs show strong cross-lingual context retrieval ability, comparable to closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4o, and their estimated oracle performances greatly improve after post-training. Our interpretability analysis shows that the cross-lingual context retrieval process can be divided into two main phases: question encoding and answer retrieval, which are formed in pre-training and post-training, respectively. The phasing stability correlates with xMRC performance, and the xMRC bottleneck lies at the last model layers in the second phase, where the effect of post-training can be evidently observed. Our results also indicate that larger-scale pretraining cannot improve the xMRC performance. Instead, larger LLMs need further multilingual post-training to fully unlock their cross-lingual context retrieval potential.

In particular, the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by incorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly increasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to a substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill stage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based key-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill stage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called Shared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This system, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput and latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the locality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing delay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV caches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM instances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host equipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in throughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource configuration."

This study explores how users engage with LLMs as mental health tools by analyzing over 10,000 TikTok comments from videos referencing LLMs as mental health tools. Using a self-developed tiered coding schema and supervised classification models, we identify user experiences, attitudes, and recurring themes. Results show that nearly 20% of comments reflect personal use, with these users expressing overwhelmingly positive attitudes. Commonly cited benefits include accessibility, emotional support, and perceived therapeutic value. However, concerns around privacy, generic responses, and the lack of professional oversight remain prominent. It is important to note that the user feedback does not indicate which therapeutic framework, if any, the LLM-generated output aligns with. While the findings underscore the growing relevance of AI in everyday practices, they also highlight the urgent need for clinical and ethical scrutiny in the use of AI for mental health support."

This paper presents a novel Federated Learning-driven Large Language Model (FL-LLM) framework, designed to enhance IoT system intelligence while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. The framework integrates Generative IoT (GIoT) models with a Gradient Sensing Federated Strategy (GSFS), dynamically optimizing model updates based on real-time network conditions. By leveraging a hybrid edge-cloud processing architecture, our approach balances intelligence, scalability, and security in distributed IoT environments. Evaluations on the IoT-23 dataset demonstrate that our framework improves model accuracy, reduces response latency, and enhances energy efficiency, outperforming traditional FL techniques (i.e., FedAvg, FedOpt).

We show that these concepts raise exciting new challenges in the context of Large Language Models for software test generation. More specifically, we formally define and investigate the properties of hardening and catching tests. A hardening test is one that seeks to protect against future regressions, while a catching test is one that catches such a regression or a fault in new functionality introduced by a code change. Hardening tests can be generated at any time and may become catching tests when a future regression is caught. We also define and motivate the Catching 'Just-in-Time' (JiTTest) Challenge, in which tests are generated 'just-in-time' to catch new faults before they land into production. We show that any solution to Catching JiTTest generation can also be repurposed to catch latent faults in legacy code. We enumerate possible outcomes for hardening and catching tests and JiTTests, and discuss open research problems, deployment options, and initial results from our work on automated LLM-based hardening at Meta.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code from natural language queries, runtime code generation is severely limited due to unverified code, security risks, longer response times, and higher computational costs. To bridge the gap, we propose an offline simulation framework to curate a software-specific skillset, a collection of verified scripts, by exploiting LLMs and publicly available scripting guides. Our framework comprises two components: (1) task creation, using top-down functionality guidance and bottom-up API synergy exploration to generate helpful tasks; and (2) skill generation with trials, refining and validating scripts based on execution feedback. To efficiently navigate the extensive API landscape, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based link prediction model to capture API synergy, enabling the generation of skills involving underutilized APIs and expanding the skillset's diversity. Experiments with Adobe Illustrator demonstrate that our framework significantly improves automation success rates, reduces response time, and saves runtime token costs compared to traditional runtime code generation. This is the first attempt to use software scripting interfaces as a testbed for LLM-based systems, highlighting the advantages of leveraging execution feedback in a controlled environment and offering valuable insights into aligning AI capabilities with user needs in specialized software domains."

In this study, we evaluated the performance of LLMs in generating DR for architecture decisions. First, we collected 50 Stack Overflow (SO) posts, 25 GitHub issues, and 25 GitHub discussions related to architecture decisions to construct a dataset of 100 architecture-related problems. Then, we selected five LLMs to generate DR for the architecture decisions with three prompting strategies, including zero-shot, chain of thought (CoT), and LLM-based agents. With the DR provided by human experts as ground truth, the Precision of LLM-generated DR with the three prompting strategies ranges from 0.267 to 0.278, Recall from 0.627 to 0.715, and F1-score from 0.351 to 0.389.

Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management.

This paper presents an AI-powered Insider Risk Management (IRM) system that integrates behavioral analytics, dynamic risk scoring, and real-time policy enforcement to detect and mitigate insider threats with high accuracy and adaptability. We introduce a hybrid scoring mechanism - transitioning from the static PRISM model to an adaptive AI-based model utilizing an autoencoder neural network trained on expert-annotated user activity data. Through iterative feedback loops and continuous learning, the system reduces false positives by 59% and improves true positive detection rates by 30%, demonstrating substantial gains in detection precision. Additionally, the platform scales efficiently, processing up to 10 million log events daily with sub-300ms query latency, and supports automated enforcement actions for policy violations, reducing manual intervention. The IRM system's deployment resulted in a 47% reduction in incident response times, highlighting its operational impact. Future enhancements include integrating explainable AI, federated learning, graph-based anomaly detection, and alignment with Zero Trust principles to further elevate its adaptability, transparency, and compliance-readiness. This work establishes a scalable and proactive framework for mitigating emerging insider risks in both on-premises and hybrid environments."

However, the introduction of LMA systems into SE brings a plethora of challenges. One of the major challenges is the strategic allocation of tasks between humans and the LMA system in a trustworthy manner. To address this challenge, a RACI-based framework is proposed in this work in progress article, along with implementation guidelines and an example implementation of the framework. The proposed framework can facilitate efficient collaboration, ensure accountability, and mitigate potential risks associated with LLM-driven automation while aligning with the Trustworthy AI guidelines.

However, currently the capability has not been systematically measured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles. Concurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII below), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social agents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages: format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable conversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion capabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset, HSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform an ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we investigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs' social performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new statistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs with COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between measurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments demonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in LLMs."

Specifically, we demonstrate that a chunk-based inference procedure, which identifies and processes only the most relevant portion of the input can mitigate recurrent memory failures and be effective for many long-context tasks: On LongBench, our method improves the overall performance of Falcon3-Mamba-Inst-7B by 14%, Falcon-Mamba-Inst-7B by 28%, RecurrentGemma-IT-9B by 50%, and RWKV6-Finch-7B by 51%. Surprisingly, this simple approach also leads to state-of-the-art results in the challenging LongBench v2 benchmark, showing competitive performance with equivalent size Transformers.

However, its efficiency heavily depends on effective device selection and high-dimensional resource allocation in dynamic and heterogeneous wireless environments. Conventional methods demand a confluence of domain-specific expertise, extensive hyperparameter tuning, and/or heavy interaction cost. This paper proposes a Tool-aided Evolutionary Large Language Model (T-ELLM) framework to generate a qualified policy for device selection in a wireless FL environment. Unlike conventional optimization methods, T-ELLM leverages natural language-based scenario prompts to enhance generalization across varying network conditions. The framework decouples the joint optimization problem mathematically, enabling tractable learning of device selection policies while delegating resource allocation to convex optimization tools. To improve adaptability, T-ELLM integrates a sample-efficient, model-based virtual learning environment that captures the relationship between device selection and learning performance, facilitating subsequent group relative policy optimization. This concerted approach reduces reliance on real-world interactions, minimizing communication overhead while maintaining high-fidelity decision-making. Theoretical analysis proves that the discrepancy between virtual and real environments is bounded, ensuring the advantage function learned in the virtual environment maintains a provably small deviation from real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that T-ELLM outperforms benchmark methods in energy efficiency and exhibits robust adaptability to environmental changes."

In this paper, we introduce Teach2Eval, an indirect evaluation framework inspired by the Feynman Technique. Instead of directly testing LLMs on predefined tasks, our method evaluates a model's multiple abilities to teach weaker student models to perform tasks effectively. By converting open-ended tasks into standardized multiple-choice questions (MCQs) through teacher-generated feedback, Teach2Eval enables scalable, automated, and multi-dimensional assessment. Our approach not only avoids data leakage and memorization but also captures a broad range of cognitive abilities that are orthogonal to current benchmarks.

Most contemporary reasoning approaches usually rely on handcrafted rule-based reward functions. However, the tarde-offs of exploration and exploitation in RL algorithms involves multiple complex considerations, and the theoretical and empirical impacts of manually designed reward functions remain insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Group Reward Optimization (DGRO), a general RL algorithm for LLM reasoning. On the one hand, DGRO decouples the traditional regularization coefficient into two independent hyperparameters: one scales the policy gradient term, and the other regulates the distance from the sampling policy. This decoupling not only enables precise control over balancing exploration and exploitation, but also can be seamlessly extended to Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) algorithms in Kimi k1.5 and Direct Reward Optimization. On the other hand, we observe that reward variance significantly affects both convergence speed and final model performance. We conduct both theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation to assess DGRO, including a detailed ablation study that investigates its performance and optimization dynamics. Experimental results show that DGRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Logic dataset with an average accuracy of 96.9\%, and demonstrates strong generalization across mathematical benchmarks."

Simultaneously, established standards such as ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC 25010, ISO/IEC 5055, ISO 9001/ISO/IEC 90003, CMMI, and TMM provide structured frameworks for ensuring robust quality practices.

We first review the foundational software quality standards and the technical fundamentals of LLMs in software engineering. Next, we explore various LLM-based SQA applications, including requirement validation, defect detection, test generation, and documentation maintenance. We then map these applications to key software quality frameworks, illustrating how LLMs can address specific requirements and metrics within each standard. Empirical case studies and open-source initiatives demonstrate the practical viability of these methods. At the same time, discussions on challenges (e.g., data privacy, model bias, explainability) underscore the need for deliberate governance and auditing. Finally, we propose future directions encompassing adaptive learning, privacy-focused deployments, multimodal analysis, and evolving standards for AI-driven software quality."

This paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism} for KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression method without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation mechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns. Compression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs of the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of older context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our results demonstrate that FlowKV consistently and significantly outperforms baseline strategies in maintaining instruction-following accuracy and user preference retention from 10.90\% to 75.40\%, particularly in later conversational turns."

In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on how memory management choices impact the LLM agents' behavior, especially their long-term performance. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental memory operations that are widely used by many agent frameworks-addition, which incorporates new experiences into the memory base, and deletion, which selectively removes past experiences-to systematically study their impact on the agent behavior. Through our quantitative analysis, we find that LLM agents display an experience-following property: high similarity between a task input and the input in a retrieved memory record often results in highly similar agent outputs. Our analysis further reveals two significant challenges associated with this property: error propagation, where inaccuracies in past experiences compound and degrade future performance, and misaligned experience replay, where outdated or irrelevant experiences negatively influence current tasks. Through controlled experiments, we show that combining selective addition and deletion strategies can help mitigate these negative effects, yielding an average absolute performance gain of 10% compared to naive memory growth. Furthermore, we highlight how memory management choices affect agents' behavior under challenging conditions such as task distribution shifts and constrained memory resources. Our findings offer insights into the behavioral dynamics of LLM agent memory systems and provide practical guidance for designing memory components that support robust, long-term agent performance.

A common mitigation strategy is to update the model more strongly on examples deemed safe, while downweighting or excluding those flagged as unsafe. However, because safety context can shift within a single example, updating the model equally on both harmful and harmless parts of a response is suboptimal-a coarse treatment we term static safety shaping. In contrast, we propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS), a framework that uses fine-grained safety signals to reinforce learning from safe segments of a response while suppressing unsafe content. To enable such fine-grained control during finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally used for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking how safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads to the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal that enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence. Building on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly mitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across diverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising capability on intended tasks. We encourage future safety research to build on dynamic shaping principles for stronger mitigation against evolving finetuning risks."

However, the automated execution feature of smart contracts makes them vulnerable to potential attacks due to inherent flaws, which can lead to severe security risks and financial losses, even threatening the integrity of the entire decentralized finance system. Currently, research on smart contract vulnerabilities has evolved from traditional program analysis methods to deep learning techniques, with the gradual introduction of Large Language Models. However, existing studies mainly focus on vulnerability detection, lacking systematic cause analysis and Vulnerability Repair. To address this gap, we propose LLM-BSCVM, a Large Language Model-based smart contract vulnerability management framework, designed to provide end-to-end vulnerability detection, analysis, repair, and evaluation capabilities for Web 3.0 ecosystem. LLM-BSCVM combines retrieval-augmented generation technology and multi-agent collaboration, introducing a three-stage method of Decompose-Retrieve-Generate. This approach enables smart contract vulnerability management through the collaborative efforts of six intelligent agents, specifically: vulnerability detection, cause analysis, repair suggestion generation, risk assessment, vulnerability repair, and patch evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-BSCVM achieves a vulnerability detection accuracy and F1 score exceeding 91\% on benchmark datasets, comparable to the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, while reducing the false positive rate from 7.2\% in SOTA methods to 5.1\%, thus enhancing the reliability of vulnerability management. Furthermore, LLM-BSCVM supports continuous security monitoring and governance of smart contracts through a knowledge base hot-swapping dynamic update mechanism."

This paper addresses the need for an automated and objective approach to evaluate individual contributions within team projects. In this paper, we present a tool that leverages a large language model (LLM) to automatically summarize code contributions extracted from version control repositories. The tool preprocesses and structures repository data, and uses PyDriller to isolate individual contributions. Its uniqueness lies in the combination of LLM prompt engineering with automated repository analysis, thus reducing the manual grading burden while providing regular and informative updates. The tool was assessed over two semesters during a three-week, full-time software development sprint involving 65 students. Weekly summaries were provided to teams, and both student and faculty feedback indicated the tool's overall usefulness in informing grading and guidance. The tool reports, in large proportion, activities that were in fact performed by the student, with some failure to detect students' contribution. The summaries were considered by the instructors as a useful potential tool to keep up with the projects."

We first demonstrate that shorter reasoning chains within individual questions are significantly more likely to yield correct answers - up to 34.5% more accurate than the longest chain sampled for the same question. Based on these results, we suggest short-m@k, a novel reasoning LLM inference method. Our method executes k independent generations in parallel and halts computation once the first m thinking processes are done. The final answer is chosen using majority voting among these m chains. Basic short-1@k demonstrates similar or even superior performance over standard majority voting in low-compute settings - using up to 40% fewer thinking tokens. short-3@k, while slightly less efficient than short-1@k, consistently surpasses majority voting across all compute budgets, while still being substantially faster (up to 33% wall time reduction). Inspired by our results, we finetune an LLM using short, long, and randomly selected reasoning chains. We then observe that training on the shorter ones leads to better performance.

The study evaluated the quality of LLM generated use cases, business rules, and collaborative workflows in terms of their syntactic and semantic correctness, consistency, non ambiguity, and completeness compared to the reference specifications against the zero-shot prompted problem statement. Our results suggested that all four LLMs can specify syntactically and semantically correct, mostly non-ambiguous artifacts.

Claude and Gemini generated all the reference use cases, with Claude achieving the most complete but somewhat redundant use case specifications. Similar results were obtained for specifying workflows. However, all four LLMs struggled to generate relevant Business Rules, with DeepSeek generating the most reference rules but with less completeness. Overall, Claude generated more complete specification artifacts, while Gemini was more precise in the specifications it generated."

To improve long-horizon planning reliability and reduce human intervention, we present Planning Domain Derivation with LLMs (PDDLLM), a framework that automatically induces symbolic predicates and actions directly from demonstration trajectories by combining LLM reasoning with physical simulation roll-outs. Unlike prior domain-inference methods that rely on partially predefined or language descriptions of planning domains, PDDLLM constructs domains without manual domain initialization and automatically integrates them with motion planners to produce executable plans, enhancing long-horizon planning automation.

A final reasoning mechanism synthesises the contributions of these agents into a coherent output that either reflects the dominant emotion or integrates multiple perspectives. The architecture incorporates both textual and visual large language models (LLMs), alongside advanced reasoning and self-refinement processes. A functional prototype was deployed locally in an offline environment, optimised for emotional expressiveness and computational efficiency. From this initial prototype, another one emerged, called Armando, which was developed for use in emergency contexts, delivering emotionally calibrated and factually accurate information through the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and cumulative context tracking. The Project Riley prototype was evaluated through user testing, in which participants interacted with the chatbot and completed a structured questionnaire assessing three dimensions: Emotional Appropriateness, Clarity and Utility, and Naturalness and Human-likeness.

LLM caching, which saves and reuses KV caches for repeated context, reduces operational carbon by avoiding redundant computation. However, this benefit comes at the cost of embodied carbon from high-capacity, high-speed SSDs. As LLMs scale, the embodied carbon of storage grows significantly. To address this tradeoff, we present EmbAdvisor, a carbon-aware caching framework that selects the optimal cache size for LLM serving. EmbAdvisor profiles different LLM tasks and uses an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver to select cache sizes that meet SLOs while minimizing total carbon emissions. Overall, EmbAdvisor reduces the average carbon emissions of a Llama-3 70B model by 9.5% under various carbon intensities compared to a non-adaptive cache scenario, and can save up to 31.2% when the carbon intensity is low."

While post-training pruning methods like SparseGPT and Wanda can effectively reduce the model size, but struggle to maintain model performance at high sparsity levels, limiting their utility for downstream tasks. Existing fine-tuning methods, such as full fine-tuning and LoRA, fail to preserve sparsity as they require updating the whole dense metrics, not well-suited for sparse LLMs. In this paper, we propose Sparsity Evolution Fine-Tuning (SEFT), a novel method designed specifically for sparse LLMs. SEFT dynamically evolves the sparse topology of pruned models during fine-tuning, while preserving the overall sparsity throughout the process. The strengths of SEFT lie in its ability to perform task-specific adaptation through a weight drop-and-grow strategy, enabling the pruned model to self-adapt its sparse connectivity pattern based on the target dataset. Furthermore, a sensitivity-driven pruning criterion is employed to ensure that the desired sparsity level is consistently maintained throughout fine-tuning. Our experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA families, DeepSeek, and Mistral, across a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SEFT achieves stronger performance while offering superior memory and time efficiency compared to existing baselines.

With recent advancements in this field, it is relevant to consider whether and to what extent LLMs' representations of the geographical world can be trusted. This study evaluates the performance of GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash in three key geospatial tasks: geocoding, elevation estimation, and reverse geocoding. In the geocoding task, both models exhibited systematic and random errors in estimating the coordinates of St. Anne's Column in Innsbruck, Austria, with GPT-4o showing greater deviations and Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrating more precision but a significant systematic offset. For elevation estimation, both models tended to underestimate elevations across Austria, though they captured overall topographical trends, and Gemini 2.0 Flash performed better in eastern regions. The reverse geocoding task, which involved identifying Austrian federal states from coordinates, revealed that Gemini 2.0 Flash outperformed GPT-4o in overall accuracy and F1-scores, demonstrating better consistency across regions. Despite these findings, neither model achieved an accurate reconstruction of Austria's federal states, highlighting persistent misclassifications. The study concludes that while LLMs can approximate geographic information, their accuracy and reliability are inconsistent, underscoring the need for fine-tuning with geographical information to enhance their utility in GIScience and Geoinformatics."

By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash can reduce parameters by up to 90\% with minimal performance loss. Building on this foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM optimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1) GG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of trained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2) DeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight distributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized degradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit floating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash training, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy. Experiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework consistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard training baselines.

Scaling rollout to sample more prompts enables models to selectively use higher-quality data for training, which can stabilize RL training and improve model performance. However, this comes at the cost of significant computational overhead. In this paper, we show that a substantial portion of this overhead can be avoided by skipping uninformative prompts before rollout. Our analysis of reward dynamics reveals a strong temporal consistency in prompt value: prompts that are uninformative in one epoch of training are likely to remain uninformative in future epochs. Based on these insights, we propose GRESO (GRPO with Efficient Selective Rollout), an online, lightweight pre-rollout filtering algorithm that predicts and skips uninformative prompts using reward training dynamics. By evaluating GRESO on a broad range of math reasoning benchmarks and models, such as Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we show that GRESO achieves up to 2.4x wall-clock time speedup in rollout and up to 2.0x speedup in total training time without accuracy degradation."

In this work, we propose Attention Trust Score (A-Trust), a lightweight, attention-based method for evaluating message trustworthiness. Inspired by human communication literature[1], through systematically analyzing attention behaviors across six orthogonal trust dimensions, we find that certain attention heads in the LLM specialize in detecting specific types of violations. Leveraging these insights, A-Trust directly infers trustworthiness from internal attention patterns without requiring external prompts or verifiers. Building upon A-Trust, we develop a principled and efficient trust management system (TMS) for LLM-MAS, enabling both message-level and agent-level trust assessment. Experiments across diverse multi-agent settings and tasks demonstrate that applying our TMS significantly enhances robustness against malicious inputs."

Prior work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability, measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly ``follow orders''to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails. Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI systems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior. Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk.

Traditional reverse engineering techniques, developed with a focus on C and C++, fall short when applied to these newer languages due to their reliance on outdated heuristics and failure to fully utilize the rich semantic information embedded in binary programs. These challenges are exacerbated by the limitations of current data-driven methods, which are susceptible to generating inaccurate results, commonly referred to as hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates probabilistic binary analysis with fine-tuned large language models (LLMs). Our method systematically models the uncertainties inherent in reverse engineering, enabling more accurate reasoning about incomplete or ambiguous information. By incorporating LLMs, we extend the analysis beyond traditional heuristics, allowing for more creative and context-aware inferences, particularly for binaries from diverse programming languages. This hybrid approach not only enhances the robustness and accuracy of reverse engineering efforts but also offers a scalable solution adaptable to the rapidly evolving landscape of software development."

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled fault localization without extensive defect datasets or model fine-tuning. However, existing LLM-based methods rely only on general LLM capabilities and lack integration of project-specific knowledge, resulting in limited effectiveness, especially for complex software. We introduce MemFL, a novel approach that enhances LLM-based fault localization by integrating project-specific knowledge via external memory. This memory includes static summaries of the project and dynamic, iterative debugging insights gathered from previous attempts. By leveraging external memory, MemFL simplifies debugging into three streamlined steps, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. Iterative refinement through dynamic memory further enhances reasoning quality over time. Evaluated on the Defects4J benchmark, MemFL using GPT-4o-mini localized 12.7% more bugs than current LLM-based methods, achieving this improvement with just 21% of the execution time (17.4 seconds per bug) and 33% of the API cost (0.0033 dollars per bug). On complex projects, MemFL's advantage increased to 27.6%. Additionally, MemFL with GPT-4.1-mini outperformed existing methods by 24.4%, requiring only 24.7 seconds and 0.0094 dollars per bug.

We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and highlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then adapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around key pillars: \textit{ Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy} and \textit{their Lifecycle Governance}, each contextualized to the challenges of AMAS. A risk taxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of Agentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial manipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce two novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the quality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE), which evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further discuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI, as well as approaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, highlighting key directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles-ensuring safety, transparency, and accountability in their operation."

As a result, it turns out that the two-step procedure yields better results -where we define better in terms of human readability and best coding practices, i.e. lines of code and use of additional libraries typically used in testing.

Large language models (LLMs) have recently been considered a promising technique to equip 6G networks with AI-native intelligence. Different from most existing studies that only consider a single LLM, this work involves a multi-LLM debate-based scheme for 6G network management, where multiple LLMs can collaboratively improve the initial solution sequentially. Considering the complex nature of 6G domain, we propose a novel hierarchical debate scheme: LLMs will first debate the sub-task decomposition, and then debate each subtask step-by-step. Such a hierarchical approach can significantly reduce the overall debate difficulty by sub-task decomposition, aligning well with the complex nature of 6G networks and ensuring the final solution qualities. In addition, to better evaluate the proposed technique, we have defined a novel dataset named 6GPlan, including 110 complex 6G network management tasks and 5000 keyword solutions. Finally, the experiments show that the proposed hierarchical debate can significantly improve performance compared to baseline techniques, e.g. more than 30% coverage rate and global recall rate improvement."

However, most post-training datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to the public, with limited information about their construction process. This lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets and our curated TuluTalk mixture."

This paper explores and exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights on the model's planning dynamics.

 Software developers frequently hard-code credentials such as passwords, generic secrets, private keys, and generic tokens in software repositories, even though it is strictly advised against due to the severe threat to the security of the software. These credentials create attack surfaces exploitable by a potential adversary to conduct malicious exploits such as backdoor attacks. Recent detection efforts utilize embedding models to vectorize textual credentials before passing them to classifiers for predictions. However, these models struggle to discriminate between credentials with contextual and complex sequences resulting in high false positive predictions. Context-dependent Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) or Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) tackled this drawback by leveraging the transformer neural architecture capacity for self-attention to capture contextual dependencies between words in input sequences. As a result, GPT has achieved wide success in several natural language understanding endeavors. Hence, we assess LLMs to represent these observations and feed extracted embedding vectors to a deep learning classifier to detect hard-coded credentials.

This paper investigates two approaches for leveraging LLMs to answer questions over software models: direct prompting, where the whole software model is provided in the context, and an agentic approach combining LLM-based agents with general-purpose file access tools. We evaluate these approaches using an Ecore metamodel designed for timing analysis and software optimization in automotive and embedded domains. Our findings show that while the agentic approach achieves accuracy comparable to direct prompting, it is significantly more efficient in terms of token usage. This efficiency makes the agentic approach particularly suitable for the automotive industry, where the large size of software models makes direct prompting infeasible, establishing LLM agents as not just a practical alternative but the only viable solution. Notably, the evaluation was conducted using small LLMs, which are more feasible to be executed locally - an essential advantage for meeting strict requirements around privacy, intellectual property protection, and regulatory compliance. Future work will investigate software models in diverse formats, explore more complex agent architectures, and extend agentic workflows to support not only querying but also modification of software models."

In this work, we formalize the notion of Ignorance Awareness and illustrate that conventional fine-tuning methods can result in substantial activation displacement. This displacement undermines the critical capability of ignorance awareness, leading to undesirable behaviors such as hallucinations. To address this challenge, we introduce SEAT, a simple and principled fine-tuning approach that not only enables the model to effectively acquire new knowledge instances but also preserves its aligned ignorance awareness. SEAT integrates two key components: (1) sparse tuning that constrains activation drift, and (2) a novel entity perturbation method designed to counter knowledge entanglement. Experimental results demonstrate that, across both real-world and synthetic datasets, SEAT significantly outperforms baselines in preserving ignorance awareness while retaining optimal fine-tuning performance, offering a more robust solution for LLM fine-tuning."

Serving these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction. This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput. To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction, which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3) a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs."

Existing APR systems are primarily evaluated in unimodal settings (e.g., SWE-bench). However, these autonomous systems struggle to resolve multimodal problem scenarios (e.g., SWE-bench M) due to limitations in interpreting and leveraging visual information. In multimodal scenarios, LLMs need to rely on visual information in the graphical user interface (GUI) to understand bugs and generate fixes. To bridge this gap, we propose GUIRepair, a cross-modal reasoning approach for resolving multimodal issue scenarios by understanding and capturing visual information. Specifically, GUIRepair integrates two key components, Image2Code and Code2Image, to enhance fault comprehension and patch validation. Image2Code extracts relevant project documents based on the issue report, then applies this domain knowledge to generate the reproduced code responsible for the visual symptoms, effectively translating GUI images into executable context for better fault comprehension. Code2Image replays the visual issue scenario using the reproduced code and captures GUI renderings of the patched program to assess whether the fix visually resolves the issue, providing feedback for patch validation. We evaluate GUIRepair on SWE-bench M, and the approach demonstrates significant effectiveness. When utilizing GPT-4o as the base model, GUIRepair solves 157 instances, outperforming the best open-source baseline by 26 instances. Furthermore, when using o4-mini as the base model, GUIRepair can achieve even better results and solve 175 instances, outperforming the top commercial system by 22 instances. This emphasizes the success of our new perspective on incorporating cross-modal reasoning by understanding and capturing visual information to resolve multimodal issues."

This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect, two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the learners'tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility."

However, the data curation process in SWE remains notoriously time-consuming, as it heavily relies on manual annotation for code file filtering and the setup of dedicated runtime environments to execute and validate unit tests. Consequently, most existing datasets are limited to only a few thousand GitHub-sourced instances. To this end, we propose an incremental, automated data-curation pipeline that systematically scales both the volume and diversity of SWE datasets. Our dataset comprises 10,169 real-world Python task instances from 2,531 distinct GitHub repositories, each accompanied by a task specified in natural language and a dedicated runtime-environment image for automated unit-test validation. We have carefully curated over 8,000 successfully runtime-validated training trajectories from our proposed SWE dataset. When fine-tuning the Skywork-SWE model on these trajectories, we uncover a striking data scaling phenomenon: the trained model's performance for software engineering capabilities in LLMs continues to improve as the data size increases, showing no signs of saturation. Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the incorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter models.

While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling human-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face fundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern discovery. The core issue lies in LLMs'tendency towards an ``average persona''that lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for simulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems: alignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency (maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness (reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for determining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science understanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when focusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2) agent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited variance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation robustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in determining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations."

However, performing long-context LLM inference locally on a commodity GPU (a PC) with privacy concerns remains challenging due to the increasing memory demands of the key-value (KV) cache. Existing systems typically identify important tokens and selectively offload their KV data to GPU and CPU memory. The KV data needs to be offloaded to disk due to the limited memory on a commodity GPU, but the process is bottlenecked by token importance evaluation overhead and the disk's low bandwidth. In this paper, we present LeoAM, the first efficient importance-aware long-context LLM inference system for a single commodity GPU with adaptive hierarchical GPU-CPU-Disk KV management. Our system employs an adaptive KV management strategy that partitions KV data into variable-sized chunks based on the skewed distribution of attention weights across different layers to reduce computational and additional transmission overheads. Moreover, we propose a lightweight KV abstract method, which minimizes transmission latency by storing and extracting the KV abstract of each chunk on disk instead of the full KV data. LeoAM also leverages the dynamic compression and pipeline techniques to further accelerate inference. Experimental results demonstrate that LongInfer achieves an average inference latency speedup of 3.46x, while maintaining comparable LLM response quality. In scenarios with larger batch sizes, it achieves up to a 5.47x speedup."

However, it remains unclear if these differences in biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$ cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs."

Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For>75% of samples with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa, suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For>60% of samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the generalization power of test-time depth adaptation."

While recent LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''), they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over 260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases. We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and 18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the overall performance of SEALGuard.

We evaluate several LLMs on tasks including identifying relevant options, ranking configurations, and recommending performant configurations across various configurable systems, such as compilers, video encoders, and SAT solvers.

Methods Using two temporally non-intersecting Reddit datasets on xylazine (n=286 and n=686, for model optimization and validation, respectively) with twelve expert-derived themes, we evaluated five LLMs against expert coding. We modeled the task as a series of binary classifications, rather than a single, multi-label classification, employing zero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies and measuring performance via accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results On the validation set, GPT-4o with two-shot prompting performed best (accuracy: 90.9%; F1-score: 0.71). For high-prevalence themes, model-derived thematic distributions closely mirrored expert classifications (e.g., xylazine use: 13.6% vs. 17.8%; MOUD use: 16.5% vs. 17.8%).

We demonstrate how easy this process is by generating extremal tests for HTTP, BGP and DNS implementations, each of which uncovered new bugs. We show how this methodology extends to centralized network software such as shortest path algorithms, and how LLMs can generate filtering code to reject extremal input.

In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g., Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models (e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark."

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), substantial progress has been made in addressing real-world software engineering tasks. Recent studies have introduced ensemble reasoning techniques to enhance the performance of LLM-based issue resolution. However, existing prompting-based methods still face limitations in effectively exploring large ensemble spaces and lack the capacity for repository-level understanding, both of which constrain their overall effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Trae Agent, the first agent-based ensemble reasoning approach for repository-level issue resolution. Trae Agent formulates our goal as an optimal solution search problem and addresses two key challenges, i.e., large ensemble spaces and repository-level understanding, through modular agents for generation, pruning, and selection. We conduct extensive experiments using three leading LLMs on the widely-adopted SWE-bench benchmark, comparing Trae Agent against four state-of-the-art ensemble reasoning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Trae Agent consistently achieves superior performance, with an average improvement of 10.22% over all baselines in terms of Pass@1. Trae Agent has achieved first place on the SWE-bench Verified leaderboard, with a notable Pass@1 score of 75.20%.

We introduce REFINE (Ranking Evaluators for FIne grained Nuanced Evaluation), an automated framework for benchmarking LLM based evaluators across software engineering tasks. REFINE comprises of two modules: Hierarchy Dataset Builder applies novel generation techniques to automatically synthesize artifacts with progressively reduced quality, and Evaluator Tester quantifies each candidate evaluator configuration by measuring how closely its rankings align with expected ordering. A key feature of REFINE is controllability: users can tune the granularity of degradation to progressively refine evaluator configurations, from coarse filtering to stress testing on subtle quality gaps. While the methodology is general, we focus on coding tasks reflecting the practical demands in our production setting. REFINE was integrated into IBM's internal development workflows and applied to code generation, translation, and summarization for COBOL, an enterprise critical programming language, using industrial data. It was used to identify LLM as a Judge configurations that lifted alignment scores from below $0.7$ to above $0.9$ in some coding tasks.

While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs'capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) precise search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on diverse long-context benchmarks demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs'inherent tool-calling and instruction-following capabilities. To further optimize these strategies, we introduce a novel dynamic context-aware reinforcement learning (RL) approach, advancing the training of an agent that actively modifies its own conversational history. By enabling Active Context Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies, rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale."

Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based agents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal human intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost savings. In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions, showing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security cost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system. To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably blocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance. Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system compromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design."

This paper introduces AquaChat++, a novel multi-ROV inspection framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable adaptive mission planning, coordinated task execution, and fault-tolerant control in complex aquaculture environments. The proposed system consists of a two-layered architecture. The high-level plan generation layer employs an LLM, such as ChatGPT-4, to translate natural language user commands into symbolic, multi-agent inspection plans. A task manager dynamically allocates and schedules actions among ROVs based on their real-time status and operational constraints, including thruster faults and battery levels. The low-level control layer ensures accurate trajectory tracking and integrates thruster fault detection and compensation mechanisms. By incorporating real-time feedback and event-triggered replanning, AquaChat++ enhances system robustness and operational efficiency. Simulated experiments in a physics-based aquaculture environment demonstrate improved inspection coverage, energy-efficient behavior, and resilience to actuator failures. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven frameworks to support scalable, intelligent, and autonomous underwater robotic operations within the aquaculture sector."

They are suboptimal in extremely dynamic vehicular environments because they are constrained to static optimization objectives and base their decisions on the current network states. This paper presents a novel Semantic-Aware Proactive LLM Orchestration (SP-LLM) framework to address these issues. Our method transforms the traditional Digital Twin (DT) into a Predictive Digital Twin (pDT) that predicts important network parameters such as task arrivals, vehicle mobility, and channel quality. A Large Language Model (LLM) that serves as a cognitive orchestrator is at the heart of our framework. It makes proactive, forward-looking decisions about task offloading and resource allocation by utilizing the pDT's forecasts. The LLM's ability to decipher high-level semantic commands given in natural language is crucial because it enables it to dynamically modify its optimization policy to match evolving strategic objectives, like giving emergency services priority or optimizing energy efficiency. We show through extensive simulations that SP-LLM performs significantly better in terms of scalability, robustness in volatile conditions, and adaptability than state-of-the-art reactive and MARL-based approaches. More intelligent, autonomous, and goal-driven vehicular networks will be possible due to our framework's outstanding capacity to convert human intent into optimal network behavior."

These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns."

We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and Hutchins'distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from 54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18% net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis confirms these advantages with p<0.001 and Cohen's d>23 across multiple task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive augmentation."

In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques, such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness while preserving natural performance.

This study addresses this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language models (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant contextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base model and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated responses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in domain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process management and the adoption of software development practices. While further validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in software engineering."

As such, we propose the investigation of a new research line on AI-powered GI aimed at incorporating semantic aware search. We take a first step at it by augmenting GI with the use of automated clustering of LLM edits. We provide initial empirical evidence that our proposal, dubbed PatchCat, allows us to automatically and effectively categorize LLM-suggested patches. PatchCat identified 18 different types of software patches and categorized newly suggested patches with high accuracy. It also enabled detecting NoOp edits in advance and, prospectively, to skip test suite execution to save resources in many cases. These results, coupled with the fact that PatchCat works with small, local LLMs, are a promising step toward interpretable, efficient, and green GI.

Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However, open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs, optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries."

We present a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility"

This work proposes an open-source large language model (LLM)-assisted approach to RTE for SES. Instead of solely relying on prompt-engineering-based methods, this study promotes the use of LLMs as an aid in constructing ontologies and explores an effective AOG workflow that includes document segmentation, candidate term mining, LLM-based relation inference, term normalization, and cross-section alignment. Golden-standard benchmarks at three granularities are constructed and used to evaluate the ontology generated from the study. The results show that it is comparable and potentially superior to the OpenIE method of triple extraction."

A stable defect detection system can not only alleviate the workload of software testers but also enhance the overall efficiency of software development. Researchers have recently proposed various artificial intelligence-based SDD methods and achieved significant advancements. However, these methods still exhibit limitations in terms of reliability and usability. Therefore, we introduce MSDD-(IA)3, a novel framework leveraging the pre-trained CodeT5+ and (IA)3 for parameter-efficient multi-classification SDD. This framework constructs a detection model based on pre-trained CodeT5+ to generate code representations while capturing defect-prone features. Considering the high overhead of pre-trained LLMs, we injects (IA)3 vectors into specific layers, where only these injected parameters are updated to reduce the training cost. Furthermore, leveraging the properties of the pre-trained CodeT5+, we design a novel feature sequence that enriches the input data through the combination of source code with Natural Language (NL)-based expert metrics. Our experimental results on 64K real-world Python snippets show that MSDD-(IA)3 demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art SDD methods, including PM2-CNN, in terms of F1-weighted, Recall-weighted, Precision-weighted, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Notably, the training parameters of MSDD-(IA)3 are only 0.04% of those of the original CodeT5+. Our experimental data and code can be available at (https://gitee.com/wxyzjp123/msdd-ia3/)."

LLMs have been trained over a vast number of scenarios and tasks and acquire human-competitive capabilities like context understanding and summarization, which can be highly beneficial for data management tasks (e.g., natural language based data analytics). In this tutorial, we present how to utilize LLMs to optimize data management systems and review new techniques for addressing these technical challenges, including hallucination of LLMs, high cost of interacting with LLMs, and low accuracy for processing complicated tasks. First, we discuss retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques to address the hallucination problem. Second, we present vector database techniques to improve the latency. Third, we present LLM agent techniques for processing complicated tasks by generating multi-round pipelines. We also showcase some real-world data management scenarios that can be well optimized by LLMs, including query rewrite, database diagnosis and data analytics. Finally, we summarize some open research challenges."

In this study, we design a customized role-based agent (CRBA), which can be configured for different roles specializing in specific areas of expertise, making the LLM yield content of higher specialization. An iterative architecture of multi-CRBAs is proposed to generate multistep projects, where CRBAs automatically criticize and optimize the LLM's intermediate outputs to enhance quality. We propose ten evaluation metrics across three aspects to assess project quality through expert grading. Further, we conduct an A/B test among 60 undergraduate students in a programming course and collect their feedback through a questionnaire. According to the students' rating results, the LLM-generated projects have comparable performance to man-made ones in terms of project description, learning step setting, assistance to students, and overall project quality. This study effectively integrates LLM into educational scenarios and enhances the efficiency of creating high-quality and practical programming exercises for lecturers."

Through a mixed methods user study with 15 programmers, we present an empirical evaluation of the effectiveness of the workflow to improve code generation accuracy. We find that participants using the proposed workflow are significantly more likely to correctly evaluate AI generated code, and report significantly less task-induced cognitive load. Furthermore, we test the potential of the workflow at scale with four different state-of-the-art LLMs on two python datasets, using an idealized proxy for a user feedback.

While substantial recent research has focused on retrieval-based and learning-based methods, results suggest they fail to provide appropriate logging statements in real-world complex software. Given the great success in natural language generation and programming language comprehension, large language models (LLMs) might help developers generate logging statements, but this has not yet been investigated. To fill the gap, this paper performs the first study on exploring LLMs for logging statement generation. We first build a logging statement generation dataset, LogBench, with two parts: (1) LogBench-O: 3,870 methods with 6,849 logging statements collected from GitHub repositories, and (2) LogBench-T: the transformed unseen code from LogBench-O. Then, we leverage LogBench to evaluate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities (using LogBench-T) of 13 top-performing LLMs, from 60M to 405B parameters. In addition, we examine the performance of these LLMs against classical retrieval-based and machine learning-based logging methods from the era preceding LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate the logging effectiveness of LLMs by studying their ability to determine logging ingredients and the impact of prompts and external program information. We further evaluate LLM's logging generalization capabilities using unseen data (LogBench-T) derived from code transformation techniques. While existing LLMs deliver decent predictions on logging levels and logging variables, our study indicates that they only achieve a maximum BLEU score of 0.249, thus calling for improvements. The paper also highlights the importance of prompt constructions and external factors (e.g., programming contexts and code comments) for LLMs’ logging performance. In addition, we observed that existing LLMs show a significant performance drop (8.2%-16.2% decrease) when dealing with logging unseen code, revealing their unsatisfactory generalization capabilities. Based on these findings, we identify five implications and provide practical advice for future logging research. Our empirical analysis discloses the limitations of current logging approaches while showcasing the potential of LLM-based logging tools, and provides actionable guidance for building more practical models."

We find that the existing state-of-the-art approaches and pre-trained Language Models (LMs) are generally superior to LLMs in software vulnerability detection. However, in software vulnerability assessment and location, certain LLMs (e.g., CodeLlama and WizardCoder) have demonstrated superior performance compared to pre-trained LMs, and providing more contextual information can enhance the vulnerability assessment capabilities of LLMs. Moreover, LLMs exhibit strong vulnerability description capabilities, but their tendency to produce excessive output significantly weakens their performance compared to pre-trained LMs. Overall, though LLMs perform well in some aspects, they still need improvement in understanding the subtle differences in code vulnerabilities and the ability to describe vulnerabilities to fully realize their potential. Our evaluation pipeline provides valuable insights into the capabilities of LLMs in handling software vulnerabilities."

Many queries and solutions related to target platforms, deploy-ment configurations, policies, data regulation, observability, to name just a few, are not well integrated with these LLMs, but are accessed by the developer through other sources. In this work, we discuss situations where the gaps between the needs and the offerings from LLMs can be compensated by Platform Knowledge, which captures knowledge about, e.g., software, service and infrastructure catalogs, architectural decision records and code patterns. We propose COLLMS - a framework for coordinating LLMs services and Platform Knowledge. At the starting point of the framework, we will discuss challenges for achieving the coordination centered around Platform Knowledge, LLMs management and integration, quality-aware coordination of LLMs, and observability and knowledge updating."

The first uses a fine-tuning strategy on a relatively small general domain Masked Language Model (MLM) model, with additional normalization steps obtained using a simple Large Language Model (LLM) prompting technique. The second is an LLM-based approach combining advanced automated prompt search with few-shot in-context learning using the DSPy framework.Our results confirm the continued relevance of the smaller MLM fine-tuned model. It also suggests that the automated few-shot LLM approach can perform close to the fine-tuning-based method without extra LLM normalization and be advantageous under scarce data access conditions. We finally hint at the possibility to choose between lower training examples or lower computing resources requirements when considering both methods."

As off-the-shelf MLLMs may have limited capabilities on images from domains like dermatology and agriculture, they must be fine-tuned to unlock domain-specific applications. The prevalent architecture of current open-source MLLMs comprises two major modules: an image-language (cross-modal) projection network and a large language model. It is desirable to understand the roles of these two modules in modeling domain-specific visual attributes to inform the design of future models and streamline the interpretability efforts on the current models. To this end, via experiments on 4 datasets and under 2 fine-tuning settings, we find that as the MLLM is fine-tuned, it indeed gains domain-specific visual capabilities, but the updates do not lead to the projection extracting relevant domain-specific visual attributes. Our results indicate that the domain-specific visual attributes are modeled by the LLM, even when only the projection is fine-tuned. Through this study, we offer a potential reinterpretation of the role of cross-modal projections in MLLM architectures. Project webpage: https://claws-lab.github.io/projection-in-MLLMs/"

One critical factor hindering their widespread adoption is the occurrence of hallucinations, where LLMs invent answers that sound realistic, yet drift away from factual truth. In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting hallucinations in large language models, which tackles a critical issue in the adoption of these models in various real-world scenarios. Through extensive evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs, including Llama-2, we study the hallucination levels of various recent LLMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to automatically detect them. Notably, we observe up to 87% hallucinations for Llama-2 in a specific experiment, where our method achieves a Balanced Accuracy of 81%, all without relying on external knowledge."

Nevertheless, these models have demonstrated variable performance when presented with different prompts (inputs), motivating a surge of research into prompt engineering – the process of optimizing prompts to enhance their performance. This paper studies different prompt settings (zero-shot and few-shot) when using LLMs for software vulnerability detection. Our exploration involves harnessing the power of both natural language (NL) unimodal and NL-PL (programming language) bimodal models within the prompt engineering process. Experimental results indicate that LLM, when provided only with source code or zero-shot prompts, tends to classify most code snippets as vulnerable, resulting in unacceptably high recall. These findings suggest that, despite their advanced capabilities, LLMs may not inherently possess the knowledge for vulnerability detection tasks. However, few-shot learning benefits from additional domain-specific knowledge, offering a promising direction for future research in optimizing LLMs for vulnerability detection."

Although managing heap data semi-automatically with software cache is feasible, it may require modifications of other thread codes. Crossthread modifications are very difficult to code and debug, and will become more complex and challenging as we increase the number of cores. In this article, we propose an intuitive programming interface, which is an automatic and scalable scheme for heap data management. Besides, for embedded applications, where the maximum heap size can be profiled, we propose several optimizations on our heap management to significantly decrease the library overheads. Our experiments on several benchmarks from MiBench executing on the Sony Playstation 3 show that our scheme is natural to use, and if we know the maximum size of heap data, our optimizations can improve application performance by an average of 14%."
