key uncertainty events impacting on the completion time of highway construction projects,"Moghayedi, Alireza; Windapo, Abimbola",10.1007/s42524-019-0022-7,2019,this paper examines the uncertainty events encountered in the process of constructing highways  and evaluates their impact on construction time  on highway projects in south africa  the rationale for this examination stems from the view held by scholars that the construction of highways is a complex process  taking place in changing environments and often beset by uncertainties  and that there is a lack of appropriate evaluation of these uncertainty events occurring during the construction process  the research made use of a review of extant literature in the area of uncertainty management  and modeling in infrastructure projects  to guide the direction of the study  the inquiry process consisted of brainstorming by highway experts and interviewing them to identify the uncertainty factors that impact construction time an uncertainty matrix for south african highway projects was developed  using a quantitative model and descriptive statistics  it emerged from the study that the uncertainty events affecting the construction time of highway projects are distributed across economic  environmental  financial  legal  political  social and technical factors  also  it was found that each factor might account for several uncertainty events which impact on construction time differently  through a combination of the uncertainty events of the individual construction activities based on the obtained data  an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system  anfis  has been developed  as a simple  reliable and accurate advanced machine learning technique to assess the impact of uncertainty events on the completion time of highway construction projects  to validate the anfis model  the stepwise regression  sr  models have been designed and their results are compared with the results of the anfis  based on the predicted impact size of uncertainty events on the time of highway projects  it can be concluded that construction time on south african highway projects is significantly related to the social and technical uncertainties factors ,key uncertainty events impacting on the completion time of highway construction projects,abimbolaalirezamoghayediwindapo
